# Call for Papers

The International Symposium on Advances in Technology Education (ISATE) event started in 2007 as international academic exchange between ten engineering colleges (known as Kosen in Japan) in the Kyushu and Okinawa districts of Japan, and three polytechnics in Singapore. It aimed to enhance the quality of Engineering Education in each participating institution. In 2010, all the other Kosen institutions of Japan joined the symposium under the initiative of the National Institute of Technology (NIT). In 2011, two more polytechnics from Singapore joined this international exchange effort as organizers. In 2013, Nagaoka University of Technology and Toyo¬hashi University of Technology also joined the sympo¬sium. Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education (IVE) of Vocational Training Council (VTC) officially joined to become one of the ISATE organizers in 2017. 

Singapore Polytechnic (SP) is proud to be the host for ISATE 2024. It will be held in SP campus [https://www.sp.edu.sg/map](https://www.sp.edu.sg/map)

These are informal discussions of a topic proposed by a roundtable facilitator. The goal of a roundtable discussion can be, for example, to generate ideas for a particular problem facing engineering educators or to collaborate on a new advancement within ISATE. Roundtables in ISATE are allocated 90 minutes.

Proposal for roundtable should use the prescribed template, with an Activity Description that describes a topic and outline of the session, with discussion questions. Resources needed for the roundtable must be specified.
