**Submission Categories**

*Paper Presentation*

Only paper presentations will be used for ISATE 2024. There will be NO poster presentations. In addition, only academic papers will be accepted. Authors who wished to present scientific works are respectfully requested to share their works elsewhere.

The maximum length for a paper is 6 pages, including references. The paper submission will undergo the following process:

1. Submission of an abstract using the prescribed template, and between 300-400 words; for review 
2. Submission of a full paper using the prescribed template; for review
3. Submission of the final version of full paper duly revised taking reviewer suggestions into account.

In addition, the main author must also submit an Approval Certificate to address the necessary copyright requirements. 

Paper presentations will follow a traditional conference format of multiple, parallel tracks with short presentations (15 minutes, using PowerPoint) followed by Q&A (5 minutes). There is no template for PowerPoint presentations

*Roundtable Discussion*

These are informal discussions of a topic proposed by a roundtable facilitator. The goal of a roundtable discussion can be, for example, to generate ideas for a particular problem facing engineering educators or to collaborate on a new advancement within ISATE. Roundtables in ISATE are allocated 90 minutes.

Proposal for roundtable should use the prescribed template, with an Activity Description that describes a topic and outline of the session, with discussion questions. Resources needed for the roundtable must be specified.
