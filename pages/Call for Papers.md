# Call for Papers

The International Symposium on Advances in Technology Education (ISATE) event started in 2007 as international academic exchange between ten engineering colleges (known as Kosen in Japan) in the Kyushu and Okinawa districts of Japan, and three polytechnics in Singapore. It aimed to enhance the quality of Engineering Education in each participating institution. In 2010, all the other Kosen institutions of Japan joined the symposium under the initiative of the National Institute of Technology (NIT). In 2011, two more polytechnics from Singapore joined this international exchange effort as organizers. In 2013, Nagaoka University of Technology and Toyo¬hashi University of Technology also joined the sympo¬sium. Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education (IVE) of Vocational Training Council (VTC) officially joined to become one of the ISATE organizers in 2017.
