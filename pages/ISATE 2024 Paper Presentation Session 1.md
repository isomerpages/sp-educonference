<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In 2021, a new function, Reading Progress was added to Microsoft Teams.
Using this function, students record themselves reading out loud and those
recordings are automatically evaluated by an auto-detect system with artificial
intelligence. In 2022, assignments using this function were given to the
4th-grade students at a technology college twice in the author’s English
class. The results showed that Reading Progress can help students practice
reading passages aloud continuously and relieve their stress with reading,
although the evaluation was not always accurate. The following year, with
improvements based on the previous reading practice results, assignments
using the same function were given to 2nd-grade students ten times in the
author’s English class throughout the year. In this paper, the data from
student submissions is analysed, and the result of a questionnaire administered
to those students after the completion of the assignments is reported.
Based on the analysis and results, areas for improvement are suggested.</p>
<p>In all the assignments, students were asked to read passages from their
textbooks aloud and submit their best recordings on Microsoft Teams. According
to the analysis of assignments from 57 students, their accuracy rate varied
between 80 to 90 percent and their WPM (words per minute) were between
70 to 100. In addition, the number of mispronounced words was 12 on average.
Therefore, the selected passages and their lengths were appropriate considering
the English level of the students. However, their submission rate gradually
decreased as time passed.</p>
<p>Additionally, according to the questionnaire, approximately 70 percent
of the students had practiced reading the passages aloud before recording.
Moreover, approximately 65 percent of the students answered that they had
felt relaxed while recording and that this app helped them improve their
English pronunciation. Additionally, most students were quite satisfied
with its function and they answered that they could use this app with little
trouble. Contrary to these positive reactions, this app did not help relieve
anxiety and build confidence when students read passages aloud in front
of others. It is necessary to make improvements to enhance the students’
motivation and increase their enjoyment.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The foundational module on critical thinking and problem-solving skills
face challenges due to its large class size, with educators struggling
to provide timely responses to students' questions and manage repeated
queries. To address this, a GenAI (generative artificial intelligence)
chatbot-assisted learning is proposed as a solution to offer immediate,
personalised assistance, enabling students to independently find, organise,
and evaluate information. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the
chatbot's effectiveness in enhancing students' motivation, improving their
critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. The study employed a single
group pre-test post-test design. Participants were 134 first-year polytechnic
students undertaking the Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving skill module.
Data were collected using online pre- and post-survey with open-ended questions
to elicit feedback on participants' GenAI chatbot-assisted learning, and
pre- and post-test. The surveys included learning motivation subscales
measuring intrinsic goal orientation, extrinsic goal orientation, task
value and self-efficacy adapted from the Motivated Strategies for Learning
Questionnaire (MSLQ) and learning strategies subscales measuring critical
thinking and problem-solving adapted from the 21st Century Learning Survey.
Paired sample t-test indicated a significant increase in learning performance,
self-efficacy, and extrinsic goal orientation in students following the
chatbot-assisted learning. Regression results indicated that the motivational
variables accounted for 51% of the variance in problem-solving, with task
value being the most significant predictor (β = .32, p &lt; .001) followed
by extrinsic motivation and self-efficacy. Hierarchical regression analysis
indicated that critical thinking accounted for an additional 4% of the
variance in problem-solving, with task value (β = .27, p &lt; .001), critical
thinking (β = .30, p &lt; .01) and self-efficacy (β = .19, p &lt; .05)
as significant predictors of problem-solving. The results of the study
provided insights into the considerations that educators can take when
designing chatbot-assisted learning to develop problem-solving skills.
Study limitations and directions for future research are discussed in the
paper.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Teaching writing skills to students is an essential issue in English education
in Japan because Japanese are generally said not to be better at writing
and speaking English than reading and listening. Despite teacher’s efforts,
English-writing education doesn’t work well because teachers, on the one
hand, cannot afford to correct the scripts of all students in a class,
and students, on the other hand, usually have trouble judging whether their
sentences are correct or not in their self-study. To solve this problem,
some companies have developed English applications with AI automatic correction.
This kind of app may allow teachers to overcome the issue above, but few
data on its effectiveness are available. We aim to measure, in this research,
how effectively the app develops students’ writing skills. More than 12
open-recruited students do English writing exercises in the AI app “English
4skills” developed by NTT Docomo from February to September 2024. At first,
we check their skill with level check tests in the app every month, then
TOEIC IP S&amp;W Test and Eiken-referred writing examinations conducted
by the authors every three months. As the dataset the app can provide for
this research, we have the number of drills students have tried and the
figure of levels indicating students’ writing ability. The result of the
TOEIC IP S&amp;W Test is objective data on the student’s writing level.
We correlated these datasets with each other and gained 0.01 of the correlation
coefficient between the training and improvement for two months. The app
seems worth joining KOSEN English education if the training-improvement
correlation gets strongly positive. Besides, we deal with questionnaires
answered by students about the app to analyze the pedagogical merits of
the app and the technical or psychological problems using it. In this way,
we clarify the possibility that the AI app contributes to English education
in Japan. We conduct this research with the approval of the research ethics
committee of NIT Wakayama College.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational assessments
has ushered in a new era of efficiency and accuracy, yet it has concurrently
raised significant ethical concerns. This paper addresses the critical
need for a robust ethical framework in AI-assisted educational assessments.
It presents an in-depth analysis of the triadic ontological framework,
previously proposed by Lim, Gottipati, and Cheong (2023), utilizing Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) to validate its applicability and effectiveness.
The framework comprises three primary domains—physical, cognitive, and
information—and incorporates five stages of the assessment pipeline: system
design and check, data stewardship and surveillance, assessment construction
and rollout, assessment administration, and grading and evaluation. Key
ethical elements such as inclusivity, fairness, accountability, accuracy,
auditability, explainability, privacy, trust, human centricity, and cheating
mitigation strategies are integrated within this framework. The research
objectives focus on two main areas: (1) validating the triadic theoretical
framework through SEM analysis, including an examination of how it reflects
learners' perceptions, and (2) investigating the relationships between
the stages of the assessment pipeline, key ethical elements, output variables,
and learner perceptions. Findings from this study reveal significant insights
into the interplay between AI-assisted educational assessment stages, ethical
considerations, and learner perspectives. These insights underscore the
necessity for frameworks that are not only theoretically sound but also
practically relevant and responsive to learner needs. The findings underscore
the need for a holistic approach in embedding AI into educational assessments,
balancing technological advancement with ethical responsibility and pedagogical
effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>At present, students in polytechnic institutions study anatomy and physiology
using interactive quizzes, videos, and stationary 3D models. However, many
students struggle to visualise human organ anatomy and physiology within
human body systems. To address this challenge, there is a growing utilization
of three-dimensional (3D) visualization technologies in enhancing anatomy
curricula, aiming to enhance comprehension of the intricate spatial relationships
inherent in the human body. In this study, we adopted one of these technologies
on mixed reality (MR) to teach anatomy with 3D images of human organs overlaid
with the physical environment. This present study aims to investigate the
impacts of virtual reality qualities, namely interaction (IT), imagination
(IG) and immersion (IM) on perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness
(PU) and behavioural intention to use (BI) HoloLens in a mixed reality
environment. Participants were 223 polytechnic students taking a module
on anatomy and physiology, and they participated in a HoloLens activity,
which was developed for the lesson on cardiovascular and lymphatic systems.
A cross-sectional quantitative research design was employed using an online
questionnaire with closed-ended questions. Six subscales on IT, IG, IM,
PEU, PU and BI were investigated. The results showed that IT, IG and IM
had significant correlations with PEU (.60 ≤ r ≤.66, p &lt; .01) and PU
(.69 ≤ r ≤.73, p &lt; .01). PEU and PU had significant correlations with
BI, i.e. r=.53 and r=.74 respectively, p &lt; .01. Regression analysis
showed that IG (β = .37, p&lt;.001) is the strongest significant predictor
of PEU, followed by IT (β = .26, p&lt;.01). For PU, IG (β = .34, p&lt;.001)
was also a significant predictor, followed by IT (β = .24, p&lt;.01) and
IM (β = .25, p &lt;.01). Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that
both PU (β = .45, p &lt; .001) and IM (β = .26, p &lt;.001) were significant
predictors of BI. The results of the study provided insights for educators
to better understand the qualities of virtual reality (VR) when using HoloLens
as an instructional activity. The implications of findings, study limitations,
and future research will be discussed in the paper.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>A 2023 survey of 131 students at two separate educational institutions
in Japan—Tokuyama College of Kosen and Yamaguchi University—suggests that
the use of the online quiz generator Kahoot in conjunction with the textbook
“CLIL Primary SDGs” improved classroom atmosphere, and encouraged active
participation, discussion, and collaboration with peers. Kahoot assisted
this in several ways: by enabling a more engaging introduction to key concepts;
by providing opportunities for non-verbal, active engagement in lesson
activities; and by awarding points and thus enabling competition among
students. The ability to engage online provided further benefits: it allowed
shy or reticent students chances to engage in English production with less
fear of mistakes being made public; it provided students a gauge of knowledge
performance relative to classmates; and it gave students a chance to express
opinions anonymously for the whole class to see, and to witness classroom
responses to those opinions. Further, Kahoot worked well in conjunction
with Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) methods, in setting
context, role-play, reading and fact-checking, and problem-solving stages
of lessons. Kahoot’s automatically generated reports enabled tracking of
student participation as a function of text input and quizzes taken. A
further range of activities, plus more opportunities for assessment of
student understanding and performance, were enabled using ChatGPT (Chat
Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) to generate reading quizzes based on
the textbook, and Microsoft Teams to enable the generation and evaluation
of online unit reviews and reading progress activities. Kahoot’s potential
positive effect on willingness to speak more in front of classmates and
on motivation to review subject matter outside of class remains unclear,
and technological issues (weak Wi-Fi signal or battery depletion) occasionally
restricted student access to the online quiz platform. Nonetheless, the
combination of CLIL methods with online teaching technologies created a
more engaging educational environment that encouraged active participation,
collaboration, and discussion with classmates.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The development of students’ abilities to hand sketch and manually model
design ideas have been a long standing, important part of built environment
courses. In recent years this has been significantly reduced in the curriculum
with preference for the use of digital drafting and 3D modelling software.
These digital activities require less development of student hands-on ability,
the interface requiring only the click of a mouse and keyboard. However,
the potential benefits of higher efficiency and precision of this digital
trend seems to come with a significant loss in the intuitive sketching
and modelling abilities of recent student cohorts.</p>
<p>This paper wishes to discuss the findings of a pilot study on digital
mediums that promises a reversal of this worrying decline. The study is
on digital tools that support development of intuitive sketching and manual
modelling skills. Focus is on the use of virtual reality (VR) equipment
as well as the use of digital pen &amp; tablet as the main medium of formulating
3D design ideas with interest for conceptual design of built environment
projects.</p>
<p>The research is supported by analysing the empirical artefacts and firsthand
experience of the users. For an objective comparison, artefacts produced
use software that supports both mediums.</p>
<p>In terms of the user experience, observations and interviews with second
year built environment students who participated in the study will be used.</p>
<p>Student’s feedback were also useful insights on how novice users faired
in steadily developing their abilities to use the mediums. The research
will initially conduct a comparison between mediums when used separately.
This is done on different stages. This starts from a comparison of the
process of setting up each medium. Subsequently comparison is done on the
day-to-day use of the mediums. Finally, a qualitative comparison is done
of the expanse and limits of conceptual forms that could be finally achieved
by each medium.</p>
<p>A further study was then conducted on the possible combined use of the
two mediums. This analysis is done on how one medium could be further developed
in another medium. The findings of this study were then used to envision
arrangements for deployment of the mediums in larger class settings. This
encompasses feasible ratios between VR and digital tablet-based equipment
in the classroom setting. The different medium could also be tailored to
different class scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the age of Society 5.0 which is the concept of a future society developed
by the Japanese government, STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art,
and mathematics) human resources with skills to grasp things from multiple
perspectives and solve problems is required. Furthermore, Society 5.0 indicates
that the National Institute of Technology (KOSEN) becomes the STEAM center
for elementary and junior high school students, as part of the efforts
to establish a system that supports STEAM education.</p>
<p>Since 2019, we have practiced STEAM education as part of “Liberal Arts
Seminar” for 4th-year students of the main course. In these lectures, the
teachers of liberal arts subjects present themes using their specialties,
such as mathematics, debate, and economics. Collaborative learning between
students from various departments led them　to deep learning, which was
a fusion of knowledge and creation. However, there are few opportunities
to give back to society, particularly as a platform to disseminate the
acquired mathematics ability. Thus, we aim to realize early STEAM education
and give back to society by creating STEAM teaching materials on art and
mathematics in open courses for junior high school students with help from
teaching assistants who studied the relation between art and mathematics
in the liberal arts seminar.</p>
<p>We consider a teaching material on tiling (like Escher’s print) from the
perspective of STEAM education as a fusion of art and mathematics. The
tiling problem asks if what kind of figures can be used for tiling since
the age of ancient Greeks. The purpose of the course is not only arousing
students' interest in mathematics, but also providing them with clues to
develop their multifaceted ideas.</p>
<p>In this report, we introduce a STEAM teaching material on tiling, and
we consider the result of the practice of an open course. Finally, we verify
the effectiveness of our teaching material by considering the results of
the exercises for participants and comparing the results of questionnaires
before and after the practice.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In asynchronous e-learning, students engage with online materials at their
own pace during the process of learning. However, not all students are
able to wield the same degree of self-discipline and motivation necessary
for successful self-directed learning in such lessons. Motivation and engagement
with peers play a crucial role in fostering effective learning and influencing
academic motivation. This is especially important in asynchronous e-learning,
where the lack of social interaction may induce feelings of isolation that
have a direct impact on students’ motivation and learning. This study delves
into the potential benefits of peer collaboration to address this challenge.</p>
<p>A mixed-method approach was used to assess the impact of peer collaboration
on students' motivation in asynchronous e-learning. The research involved
146 students from both Art and Science disciplines at NYP and RP. Quantitative
data was gathered using pre- and post-lesson survey questionnaires. Qualitative
data was obtained through informal focus group discussions. The instructional
approach investigated involved breaking down the asynchronous lesson into
manageable activities, incorporating digital video creation as well as
peer questioning and answering as collaborative tasks to promote engagement
and critical thinking among students.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest the integration of peer collaboration through digital
video creation and peer questioning proved highly effective in enhancing
motivation, engagement, and understanding within the lesson. Thus, overall
had a positive impact on students’ self-directed learning. Students found
the bite-sized activities manageable and reported a diminished feeling
of isolation, underscoring the inherent value of peer collaboration. Furthermore,
collaborative tasks grounded in accountability and shared responsibility
emerged as catalysts that enhanced motivation, critical thinking, and engagement.</p>
<p>This study imparts invaluable insights to educators, stressing the importance
of a social presence in asynchronous e-learning, and of setting clear guidelines
and expectations in collaborative tasks. Our qualitative findings did reveal
potential challenges, including issues related to group dynamics and delayed
peer responses, prompting the need for future considerations and improvements.
Overall, our study paved the way to fine-tune implementation strategies,
ensuring ongoing success in cultivating collaborative tasks and improving
motivation in asynchronous e-learning environments.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Efforts using data science are being made towards the realization of Hydrogen
Society, fostering momentum in communities and understanding current challenges.
Construction costs for hydrogen infrastructure, such as hydrogen stations,
present a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Additionally, the
lack of sufficient data regarding location conditions, operation conditions,
and high-pressure gas safety regulations calls for the application of data
science from various perspectives.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to provide data science education to students
at National Institutes of Technology (KOSEN) and to evaluate the educational
effectiveness in cultivating engineers for the realization of a hydrogen
society. In a class titled 'Fundamentals of Design,' we educated three
second-year students on analyzing scatter plots and correlation coefficients
between the number of hydrogen stations and various datasets using the
Python programming language. While numerical processing in this class could
be accomplished with spreadsheet software like Excel, we also incorporated
programming for data processing tasks to practice handling large volumes
of data. Initially, students tackled practice problems analyzing the correlation
between population data of cities and towns in Aichi Prefecture and the
presence of hydrogen stations. They then set their own research themes,
exploring data potentially related to hydrogen stations. Students independently
developed research themes and presented their findings on various aspects
of hydrogen stations. Additionally, a five-year student employed Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) to foster the diffusion of Hydrogen Stations
through data science education as his graduate research. Given that hydrogen
is a by-product in petrochemical plants, the student hypothesized a relationship
between Hydrogen Stations and petrochemical plants, conducting a mapping
analysis in the Tokai region. This novel data analysis in the Tokai region
utilized GIS to visually clarify geographical data, mapping the relationship
between Hydrogen Stations and petrochemical plants. Future plans include
improving our GIS mappings to better analyze and promote the spread of
Hydrogen Stations.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) has implemented Flipped Learning (FL) campus-wide
since Academic Year (AY) 2022/2023. NP adopts a 40:60 curricular guidepost
where approximately 40% of the core curriculum is experienced as Online
Asynchronous Learning (OAL) and 60% as In-Person Learning (IPL). Fundamentally,
NP implements FL to contribute towards developing and honing students’
self-directedness. As recently established by Khodaei et al (2022), FL
can develop self-directedness if implemented appropriately. However, as
concluded by Park and Suh (2021) and Kapur et al (2022), how FL is implemented
can critically impact any improvements in student learning.</p>
<p>At NP, students learn foundational content interactively during OAL, for
example through activities such as quizzes with feedback, online discussion,
short video clips etc. Lecturers design OAL in a manner that generates
data in NP’s learning management system from students’ engagement with
these OAL activities. This data provides lecturers insights on their students’
learning progress and enables lecturers to adjust IPLs as needed to better
scaffold students’ learning. The IPL scaffolds include opportunities for
in-person collaborative learning.</p>
<p>This paper will discuss the details of NP’s survey of students’ perception
on their FL experience. The survey requested NP students to rate 10 items,
each on a 5-point Likert scale, on 10 key aspects of their FL experience
over 2 semesters in AY 2023/2024. Key aspects surveyed included the use
of interactive self-checks with feedback, how OAL prepared students for
IPL and how IPL helped students to apply their OAL learning. Responses
to the survey, and each survey item, were optional. Overall, just under
2000 students responded to our survey in April 2023 semester and about
1480 students in October 2023 semester.</p>
<p>In both semesters, between 71% and 87% of all survey respondents Strongly
Agreed or Agreed (“SA+A”) with all survey items. SA+A approval percentages
were generally higher in October 2023 semester than in April. The lowest
ratings of 71% in April and 79% in October 2023 semester were for the item
on whether learning analytics were useful to inform students of their learning
progress.</p>
<p>Focus groups were conducted at the end of each semester where students
provided more details of their FL experiences, challenges, and suggestions
for improvement. These discussions corroborated survey findings and provided
us with actionable suggestions for improvement.</p>
<p>Our study of students’ perceptions of NP’s implementation of Flipped Learning
provides encouraging insights for others considering how to improve learning
using data-driven FL.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Toyota KOSEN organized the KOSEN Global Camp (KGC) from February 19th
to 25th, 2024. Fourteen international participants from U.K. College, Vietnam
University, Thai high schools, and 25 Japanese KOSEN students, including
international exchange students from Malaysia, Mongolia, and Cambodia,
participated in this camp. The workshop theme was "Recognizing the Public
Urban Space and Working towards a Proposal for a Future Smart City". The
workshop aimed to identify public spaces for civilians, build a miniature
urban design using LEGO and propose an ideal future city. The students
learned how to plan a future smart city through practical experience and
collaborative work, using their and other people's areas of experience.
The workshop also aimed to develop global citizenship (GC) skills, such
as "Knowledge and Understanding", "Abilities and Skills", and "Attitude,
Stances, and Values". The groups to build the smart city comprised one
international exchange student, 2 or 3 students from overseas, and 2 or
3 Japanese KOSEN students. They had to use English to discuss their smart
city during the workshop. On DAY 2, the participants designed a city as
a group work using architecture design-build LEGO. The lecturer, who specialized
in urban planning at the university, provided the urban designing aspect
in the morning, and the participants walked around Toyota City to observe
city planning and smart city content on DAY 3. As for obtaining the domestic
aspects from the local citizens, the dialogue with citizens was held on
DAY 4. The final presentation to show their ideal smart city was held on
DAY 5 after they redesigned and built the urban planning with LEGO. All
student participants had increased their global citizenship skills through
this workshop in a questionnaire survey. It was observed that the GC skills
of Japanese participants significantly improved after attending the camp,
in contrast to the international students who studied in KOSEN. The strength
of our global camp lies in the ability to enhance the "Abilities and Skills"
required for global citizenship.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The ability to achieve an optimum design based on specifications is a
skill that should be developed in the mechanical engineering program. We
have developed a “self-enlightenment” engineering educational scheme for
designing, creating, and evaluating through the spontaneous participation
of students themselves. The most significant feature is providing experiences
such as machining to create “real (not virtual)” parts to assemble and
form real products with one’s own hands. Achieving this goal requires students
to repeat the design cycle (CAD-CAE) to avoid any mistakes in the final
products produced by CAM. Evaluating the final product can reveal how well
the design cycle worked yet you may find some unexpected things and why
that happens. In recent years, we used a “smartphone stand” as the targeted
product and the instructors providing the specifications to third-year
undergraduate students in Department of Mechanical Engineering, Toyohashi
University of Technology. Students designed and analyzed using 3D-CAD and
created component drawings. Through analyses (e.g. CAE; evaluating stress
distribution and overall shape deformation), an optimal design was determined,
and students evaluated its feasibility of their design. If not satisfied,
they were encouraged to modify the design in 3D-CAD and then analyze again.
By repeating this cycle (CAD-CAE), students learn the optimization process
in design, which is often experienced in the real manufacturing processes.
Once the shapes of all parts were finalized, the CAD data was transferred
to a laser cutter device (CAM), which cuts thick paper to manufacture the
designed parts. Students assembled the parts to create their own smartphone
stands, then evaluated them in various ways to check whether they satisfied
the prescribed specifications. Generally, products do not match all specifications,
thus students consider the reasons for inconsistencies and areas for improvement,
which enhances awareness of the important aspects of engineering design.
By adopting the problem-solving and repetitive learning method using the
CAD-CAM-CAE cycle, students can improve their ability to become future
professional engineers in an efficient yet effective manner.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>The use of PracticeMe, a study tool to revise on the fundamentals of JavaScript
programming, was conceived when students feedback that there were insufficient
programming practices to enhance their learning. It was specially developed
in-house to provide a platform for students to raise their proficiency
in programming with deliberate practices within a captivating environment
using basic gamification. PracticeMe served as an extra learning tool,
besides the conventional learning resources provided e.g. lecture notes,
internet/hard copy references and weekly practical assignments. It was
targeted at Year 1 students enrolled in the core module ST0502 Fundamentals
of Programming (FOP) which introduces and builds the foundation of programming
language.</p>
<p> The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the effectiveness of
PracticeMe on improving students’ performance in programming. To assess
its efficacy, data points collected include students' results, practice
attempts, number of questions attempted, Mid-Semester Test (MST) scores
that can highlight the gaps in learning on different topics taught in the
module. Observation of the MST scores indicated that classes with lower
percentage usage of the application had lower average scores as compared
to classes with higher percentage usage of the application. The results
also indicated that PracticeMe may not be able to capture the subtle weaknesses
among the higher performing students.</p>
<p>Both qualitative and quantitative analysis were conducted to gather the
effectiveness of PracticeMe. An online survey in BrightSpace was conducted
at the end of the semester to gauge students’ perception of its usefulness
towards their learning. Results suggested that students were highly positive,
with 79% giving feedback that “it was easy and intuitive to use” and 69%
responded that “the application was helpful in directing them to focus
on their weaker topic(s)”. Students from the focus group interviews also
shared that “they were highly motivated to use PracticeMe on a daily basis
as it offered them the flexibility” to select the topics and level of difficulty
to practise at their own time.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The Final Year Project (FYP) holds a pivotal position within computing-related
diploma programs, offering students a unique opportunity to apply their
acquired knowledge and skills to real-world challenges. FYP teams often
face a range of challenges such as changing project requirements and deliverables,
communication and collaboration, time management, and unclear individual
roles and responsibilities. This research paper delves into the impact
of implementing the Scrum framework to improve teamwork as students carry
out their final year projects, aiming to identify key factors contributing
to successful implementation and subsequent improvements in team performance.</p>
<p>The Scrum framework is an agile framework that promotes collaboration
among team members. The framework focuses on improving the product through
constant inspection and adaptation to improve the final output. Researchers
have analysed the effectiveness of the Scrum framework for project and
team management in FYP teams in higher education. The findings showed that
task assignment, performance monitoring, team management and regular feedback
practices are the main advantages of using Scrum in FYP projects, which
had a positive impact on student performance.</p>
<p>The action research employed a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative
data from the Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness (CATME)
survey with qualitative insights from focus-group discussions involving
third-year Diploma in Applied AI and Analytics students. While the CATME
survey did not reveal significant statistical differences between phases
of the project, focus group discussions provided a deeper understanding
of Scrum’s positive impact on teamwork. Participants reported enhanced
collaboration, improved trust, effective decision-making, and a more inclusive
team environment due to Scrum practices.</p>
<p>These findings have led to the broader adoption of Scrum across all FYP
modules and related projects within the School of Computing. The research
underscores the value of Scrum in educational settings, offering a framework
for fostering effective teamwork and improving the overall FYP experience.
This study contributes valuable insights into the practical application
of Scrum in academia and suggests that further research could explore Scrum’s
adaptability to various project types and industry contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In nursing education, often dominated by instructor-led simulations (ILS),
there is a growing demand to explore alternative approaches, such as peer-led
simulation (PLS), in the training of post-registration nursing students.
PLS shifts learners into leadership roles, fostering scenario design and
facilitation among peers. Despite existing literature on ILS versus PLS,
there remains a gap in understanding the factors influencing the learning
experience and perceptions of PLS for post-registration nursing students.
This study aims to investigate the factors influencing the learning experience
of post-registration nursing students and their perceptions of PLS as an
instructional strategy. This qualitative study was implemented from October
2022 to April 2023. The entire student cohorts (n = 20) were recruited
from the Advanced Diploma in Nursing (Peri-anesthesia) programme. The students
underwent both ILS (14 hours) and PLS (11 hours) as part of the mandatory
activities within a 60-hour module on "Crisis Management in Anaesthesia”.
Three semi-structured FGDs with 16 participants were conducted. The FGDs
were guided by six questions on students learning experiences that were
validated using the Delphi method. The thematic analysis revealed four
major themes concerning their learning experiences: the learning journey,
enablers, barriers and perceived benefits of including PLS. Among the enablers,
one notable finding was learners' appreciation for their ability to apply
evidence-based practice principles, which played a significant role in
achieving conceptual fidelity in their developed scenarios. In conclusion,
the qualitative findings of this study emphasize the pivotal role of PLS
in creating dynamic learning environments, which are of interest to all
educators. Through active engagement in PLS through scenario design, facilitation
and debriefing, students develop a deeper understanding of theoretical
concepts and enhanced their clinical competency. As nursing education continues
to evolve, it is essential for educators to embrace innovative pedagogical
approaches like PLS to improve learning outcomes and prepare nurses for
the increased complexities of clinical practice. Beyond nursing, educators
may gain valuable insights into students' learning needs and challenges
through PLS implementation, refining teaching strategies and improving
educational effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This paper shares the process and outcomes of the efforts from the Diploma
in Chemical Engineering (DCHE) Course Management Team in evaluating the
coverage of sustainable development in the context of chemical engineering
using the CDIO Framework. The paper first presents the need and practical
context for integrating sustainable development into the DCHE program based
on the chemical engineering profession where the skills and attributes
required to achieve the intended outcome are established. Then, the 17
United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) are mapped to the
learning outcomes in each module while detailing the magnitude of coverage
of whether a specific UN SDG is ‘teach’ and/or ‘utilise’ in the modules.
The analysis involves all modules in the DCHE curriculum while noting that
the Common Core Curriculum (CCC) was implemented in DCHE since AY2022/2023
that introduced UN SDGs into the curriculum which can be further extended
to the chemical engineering domain. The paper also describes the application
of UN SDGs in the context of chemical engineering and how existing learning
activities support the development of knowledge, skills and attributes
required to address wicked problems framed by UN SDGs. It was found that
8 out of the 17 UN SDGs are used in the DCHE curriculum with UN SDG No.
12 Responsible Consumption &amp; Production being taught and utilised most
frequently. This could be due to its relevance and application in the study
of chemical engineering at the diploma level. Then, the CDIO Standards
are used to conduct a gap analysis of its existing curriculum in sustainable
development. Base on the learning gaps identified in this paper, there
are more opportunities to integrate UN SDGs into the curriculum more cohesively
in accordance to the complexity of the spiral curriculum and within the
chemical engineering context by teaching and utilising UN SDGs more explicitly
in Year 1 modules followed by applying UN SDGs in Year 2 and Year 3 modules.
This will enable students to understand the relevance of UN SDGs to their
chemical engineering studies. The terminal objective is to enable them
to extend their learning to address multi-faceted sustainability issues.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>For students to be socially and economically independent and begin fulfilling
lives after graduation, it is critical that they be motivated and allocate
their time and money to various self-investments from the moment they enroll
in school. KOSEN provides numerous opportunities for students to showcase
the results of their investments, such as programming contests. Participating
in such events allows students to clarify their career goals. By improving
their knowledge and skills, students can raise their expectations, allowing
them to contribute more as engineers. Furthermore, improving their financial
literacy boosts students’ sense of independence and motivation to pursue
specialized subjects. Therefore, in this study, we conducted an engineering
class incorporating career and financial elements to help students improve
their expectations and awareness of self-investments and examined the educational
effects of conducting this class.</p>
<p>The class was held during the second-year engineering subject “Electromagnetism”
and the fifth-year subject “Electronic Devices.” First, a teacher explained
the importance of life and career planning as career elements and self-analysis
methods. Second, to specifically raise the students’ expectations, on the
teachers discussed financial literacy, including how to protect and increase
money, which is a substitute for value, as well as compound interest and
discounted present value. Furthermore, to connect the students’ specialized
subjects with financial literacy, the students were given an assignment
to calculate the investment yield of solar power generation, which can
be considered a financial innovation created by solar cells, one of the
most important electronic devices. For this assignment, students created
their own teaching materials that allowed them to measure the power generated
by solar cells as well as the panel temperature indoors.</p>
<p>A questionnaire distributed to students who took the class revealed that
KOSEN students are open about their careers and have a strong aptitude
for finance. Furthermore, students demonstrated an understanding of the
relationship between solar power generation principles and investment concepts.
Furthermore, as a result of implementing this class, students’ preference
for self-investment increased, with a high proportion of students studying
specialized subjects, pursuing qualifications, and investing. As a result,
it was clear that this class increased students’ motivation to study and
their level of understanding of specialized subjects.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Learning Experience Design (LXD) represents a paradigm shift in lesson
design by advocating learner- and learning-centric rather than traditional
content- and instruction-centric lesson design. LXD addresses emerging
T&amp;L challenges such as complex learning environments, accounting for
learner diversity and the development of transferable and domain skills.
In this research, case studies conducted by 8 educators across 5 diplomas
in Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) establish the effectiveness of employing an
LXD methodology. The goal is to enhance learner engagement, through catering
to diverse learners’ needs while addressing environmental challenges, so
as to facilitate the achievement of learning outcomes in an efficient,
effective and enjoyable manner. This research seeks to validate that the
application of LXD principles improves learner engagement, as evidenced
through 7 enhanced learning attributes, namely; Application, Problem-Solving,
Collaboration, Autonomy, Confidence, Appreciation and Connection. These
attributes contribute to Meaningful, Motivational and Memorable learning
(3M). Over two semesters across 2021 &amp; 2022, 8 educators from NYP applied
LXD principles in the design of learning activities to address specific
challenges of the learner and in the learning environment. Before and after
the implementation of the designed activities, students participated in
a survey. Educators kept a journal of the experience to reflect and record
the experience. The LXD Methodology described in this paper was developed
by NYP with reference to the school’s Effective and Engaging Teaching &amp;
Learning (EETL) model. This was complemented with a collation of best practices
on learning design for learner engagement. A group of NYP educators applied
this methodology strategically to address specific classroom or learner
challenges and found that learner engagement was enhanced. Case studies
compiling the educators' experiences and quantitative results validating
the findings are presented in this research. When applied in a considered
and consistent manner to address challenges of the learner and in the learning
environment, the LXD Methodology fosters greater learner engagement.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>With an increasing emphasis on inclusive education, especially for students
with diverse learning needs, some research has proposed Universal Design
for Learning (UDL) as a possible framework to cater for such needs. However,
to what extent can UDL interventions provide for such needs? This study
examines the differences in students’ perceptions of the three UDL principles:
engagement (ENG), representation (REP), and action &amp; expression (ACT),
and their possible effects on the situational interests (SI) and self-efficacy
(SE) of the students. This will address the gap in the paucity of studies
on UDL in post-secondary settings in Asian educational institutions. The
data collection involved 120 polytechnic students enrolled in the Biopsychosocial
of Ageing module in a Polytechnic in Singapore, who completed pre- and
post-UDL intervention questionnaires. The questionnaire, validated before
the study, assessed UDL principles, SI, and SE. The results showed significant
improvements in students' perceptions of ENG, REP, ACT, SI, and SE post-UDL
intervention, highlighting the positive impact of UDL on students’ motivation.
The study also revealed strong correlations between UDL principles, SI,
and SE in the post-intervention, suggesting an interconnected nature of
these variables. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the UDL
principles on REP and ENG were significant predictors of both SI and SE
as dependent variables. Implications for practice include considerations
for implementing UDL in curriculum design and teaching strategies, such
as promoting active engagement, providing diverse representation of content,
and facilitating varied modes of expression. In conclusion, this study
provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of UDL interventions
within a module in polytechnic education, emphasising its potential to
improve students' motivations and learning experiences.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The pervasive influence of technology challenges students’ cognitive and
socio-emotional development through digital connectivity issues of maintaining
attention, fostering isolation. This hinders the development of both interpersonal
skills and critical thinking essential for effective communication, social
engagement, and problem-solving – skills increasingly crucial in the evolving
landscape of work. Consequently, students face difficulties addressing
their academic and personal concerns, hindering their development.</p>
<p>Dalvi, Sawant, and Sambhaji (2023) highlighted the critical role of educators
in addressing these challenges by focusing on psychological outcomes of
digital education. In response, the proposed Converse Canvas uses guided
dialogue as a catalyst for cognitive and socio-emotional development during
Careperson hour. The implementation of Converse Canvas serves as a case
study of how it can contribute to fostering self-directed learners and
resilient youths.</p>
<p>The Careperson session involved students utilising a deck of cards featuring
structured and diverse topics, curated to address issues relevant to students’
academic journey. Students select a resonant card, reflecting upon their
challenges, and are guided through subsequent steps for tailored solutions.
Converse Canvas generates meaningful conversation based on shared challenges
within a peer-driven learning environment.</p>
<p>The case study revealed that it also serves as a forecasting tool. Students
gained awareness of potential challenges they may encounter, enabling them
to anticipate obstacles in the future. With improved foresight, students
experienced reduced stress levels as they prepared for upcoming challenges.
Findings gathered from this pilot study unveiled a spectrum of challenges,
spanning from adjusting to new pedagogical approaches in the first year
to societal integration in subsequent years. These insights have informed
iterations in the card development process, granting effective resource
allocation to be tailored to the diverse needs of students requiring support.</p>
<p>Conducting Converse Canvas for students is imperative given the increasing
complexities of the digital world. Adopting this tool helps students gain
autonomy over their learning experiences and cultivate a growth mindset.
Converse Canvas has shown to be an efficacious approach to nurture resilience
in students navigating academic transitions and subsequently, the evolving
professional landscape.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This study investigates the development and application of monitoring
equipment for sound vibration in neuroscience, focusing on its effects
on high school students' academic performance and psychological well-being.
The premise of the research is based on the phenomenon where sound vibrations
from speech induce vibrations in the cranial bones, which is hypothesized
to improve cerebrospinal fluid circulation, thus enhancing nutrient exchange
within brain tissues. This enhancement could potentially elevate cognitive
capabilities, academic achievements, and reduce psychological stress among
students.</p>
<p>To verify the effects of sound vibration on learning outcomes, controlled
experiments were performed in schools located in Beijing and Henan, China.
The study divided participants into groups based on their habit of reading
aloud. In Beijing, an experimental group engaged in scheduled reading sessions
was compared to a control group that did not practice reading aloud. The
participants were students without a pre-existing habit of reading aloud,
and the reading material covered subjects like language arts and English.
The sessions were integrated into the school's daily schedule. A novel,
wearable head-mounted device developed in collaboration with Tsinghua University's
Architectural Acoustics Laboratory measured the sound vibration levels
during these sessions.</p>
<p>The research findings reveal a significant correlation between the quantity
of cranial vibration from reading aloud and improvements in students' academic
performances. The experimental group exhibited notable grade improvements,
especially in the subjects included in the reading sessions. Furthermore,
the study examined the relationship between sound vibration from reading
aloud and psychological stress by assessing changes in saliva cortisol
levels before and after the reading activities. Results demonstrated a
negative correlation between sound vibration levels and cortisol levels,
indicating that increased cranial vibration from reading aloud could potentially
lower psychological stress.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the study provides evidence that sound vibration reading
positively influences high school students' academic achievements and reduces
psychological stress. The development of a portable, head-mounted sound
vibration monitoring device presents a new avenue for leveraging the benefits
of sound vibration in educational and psychological interventions. This
research contributes to the understanding of how physiological processes
influenced by external physical stimuli, like sound vibration, can impact
cognitive and psychological outcomes, offering a novel approach to improving
student performance and well-being.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT),
defined entrepreneurship as "the spirit of creating new value by going
beyond the boundaries of the given environment”. In recent years, entrepreneurship
education has come into the limelight again. Various educational activities
are being conducted. The National Institute of Technology, Tomakomai College
established its "Frontier Course" several years ago, offering "specialized
education plus entrepreneurship education". Ideas conceived through entrepreneurship
must then be transformed them into successful businesses. Many systems
support procedures for starting businesses, but entrepreneurs must also
learn business management, which requires enormous amounts of time. Students
not specializing in business need help understanding what to do and how
to start. Although the authors can present and explain case studies of
successful companies to students learning about corporate management, it
is meaningful for students to learn more about difficulties with starting
a business and to hear the experiences of people who have failed in entrepreneurial
endeavours. The authors use analog business games in lectures to create
opportunities for students to experience management in a simulated manner
and thereby understand it in vague terms. The analog business games the
authors have produced meet their educational objectives. The supply chain
collaboration game (SCC game) used at Thammasat University in Thailand
in 2014 and 2015 was translated into Japanese and was applied for class
instruction. Merely enjoying the game might be fruitless, but they analyzed
and presented their management results. Although the students managed a
simulated company, corporate accounting tools such as balance sheets and
profit and loss statements were also prepared, facilitating students’ understanding
of information. These actions allow classes to share discussions of how
management makes erroneous decisions. The authors verified these lecture
methods as practical and as allowing students to learn business management
while having fun.</p>
