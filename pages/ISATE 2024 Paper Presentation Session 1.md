<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In 2021, a new function, Reading Progress was added to Microsoft Teams.
Using this function, students record themselves reading out loud and those
recordings are automatically evaluated by an auto-detect system with artificial
intelligence. In 2022, assignments using this function were given to the
4th-grade students at a technology college twice in the author’s English
class. The results showed that Reading Progress can help students practice
reading passages aloud continuously and relieve their stress with reading,
although the evaluation was not always accurate. The following year, with
improvements based on the previous reading practice results, assignments
using the same function were given to 2nd-grade students ten times in the
author’s English class throughout the year. In this paper, the data from
student submissions is analysed, and the result of a questionnaire administered
to those students after the completion of the assignments is reported.
Based on the analysis and results, areas for improvement are suggested.</p>
<p>In all the assignments, students were asked to read passages from their
textbooks aloud and submit their best recordings on Microsoft Teams. According
to the analysis of assignments from 57 students, their accuracy rate varied
between 80 to 90 percent and their WPM (words per minute) were between
70 to 100. In addition, the number of mispronounced words was 12 on average.
Therefore, the selected passages and their lengths were appropriate considering
the English level of the students. However, their submission rate gradually
decreased as time passed.</p>
<p>Additionally, according to the questionnaire, approximately 70 percent
of the students had practiced reading the passages aloud before recording.
Moreover, approximately 65 percent of the students answered that they had
felt relaxed while recording and that this app helped them improve their
English pronunciation. Additionally, most students were quite satisfied
with its function and they answered that they could use this app with little
trouble. Contrary to these positive reactions, this app did not help relieve
anxiety and build confidence when students read passages aloud in front
of others. It is necessary to make improvements to enhance the students’
motivation and increase their enjoyment.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The foundational module on critical thinking and problem-solving skills
face challenges due to its large class size, with educators struggling
to provide timely responses to students' questions and manage repeated
queries. To address this, a GenAI (generative artificial intelligence)
chatbot-assisted learning is proposed as a solution to offer immediate,
personalised assistance, enabling students to independently find, organise,
and evaluate information. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the
chatbot's effectiveness in enhancing students' motivation, improving their
critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. The study employed a single
group pre-test post-test design. Participants were 134 first-year polytechnic
students undertaking the Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving skill module.
Data were collected using online pre- and post-survey with open-ended questions
to elicit feedback on participants' GenAI chatbot-assisted learning, and
pre- and post-test. The surveys included learning motivation subscales
measuring intrinsic goal orientation, extrinsic goal orientation, task
value and self-efficacy adapted from the Motivated Strategies for Learning
Questionnaire (MSLQ) and learning strategies subscales measuring critical
thinking and problem-solving adapted from the 21st Century Learning Survey.
Paired sample t-test indicated a significant increase in learning performance,
self-efficacy, and extrinsic goal orientation in students following the
chatbot-assisted learning. Regression results indicated that the motivational
variables accounted for 51% of the variance in problem-solving, with task
value being the most significant predictor (β = .32, p &lt; .001) followed
by extrinsic motivation and self-efficacy. Hierarchical regression analysis
indicated that critical thinking accounted for an additional 4% of the
variance in problem-solving, with task value (β = .27, p &lt; .001), critical
thinking (β = .30, p &lt; .01) and self-efficacy (β = .19, p &lt; .05)
as significant predictors of problem-solving. The results of the study
provided insights into the considerations that educators can take when
designing chatbot-assisted learning to develop problem-solving skills.
Study limitations and directions for future research are discussed in the
paper.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Teaching writing skills to students is an essential issue in English education
in Japan because Japanese are generally said not to be better at writing
and speaking English than reading and listening. Despite teacher’s efforts,
English-writing education doesn’t work well because teachers, on the one
hand, cannot afford to correct the scripts of all students in a class,
and students, on the other hand, usually have trouble judging whether their
sentences are correct or not in their self-study. To solve this problem,
some companies have developed English applications with AI automatic correction.
This kind of app may allow teachers to overcome the issue above, but few
data on its effectiveness are available. We aim to measure, in this research,
how effectively the app develops students’ writing skills. More than 12
open-recruited students do English writing exercises in the AI app “English
4skills” developed by NTT Docomo from February to September 2024. At first,
we check their skill with level check tests in the app every month, then
TOEIC IP S&amp;W Test and Eiken-referred writing examinations conducted
by the authors every three months. As the dataset the app can provide for
this research, we have the number of drills students have tried and the
figure of levels indicating students’ writing ability. The result of the
TOEIC IP S&amp;W Test is objective data on the student’s writing level.
We correlated these datasets with each other and gained 0.01 of the correlation
coefficient between the training and improvement for two months. The app
seems worth joining KOSEN English education if the training-improvement
correlation gets strongly positive. Besides, we deal with questionnaires
answered by students about the app to analyze the pedagogical merits of
the app and the technical or psychological problems using it. In this way,
we clarify the possibility that the AI app contributes to English education
in Japan. We conduct this research with the approval of the research ethics
committee of NIT Wakayama College.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational assessments
has ushered in a new era of efficiency and accuracy, yet it has concurrently
raised significant ethical concerns. This paper addresses the critical
need for a robust ethical framework in AI-assisted educational assessments.
It presents an in-depth analysis of the triadic ontological framework,
previously proposed by Lim, Gottipati, and Cheong (2023), utilizing Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) to validate its applicability and effectiveness.
The framework comprises three primary domains—physical, cognitive, and
information—and incorporates five stages of the assessment pipeline: system
design and check, data stewardship and surveillance, assessment construction
and rollout, assessment administration, and grading and evaluation. Key
ethical elements such as inclusivity, fairness, accountability, accuracy,
auditability, explainability, privacy, trust, human centricity, and cheating
mitigation strategies are integrated within this framework. The research
objectives focus on two main areas: (1) validating the triadic theoretical
framework through SEM analysis, including an examination of how it reflects
learners' perceptions, and (2) investigating the relationships between
the stages of the assessment pipeline, key ethical elements, output variables,
and learner perceptions. Findings from this study reveal significant insights
into the interplay between AI-assisted educational assessment stages, ethical
considerations, and learner perspectives. These insights underscore the
necessity for frameworks that are not only theoretically sound but also
practically relevant and responsive to learner needs. The findings underscore
the need for a holistic approach in embedding AI into educational assessments,
balancing technological advancement with ethical responsibility and pedagogical
effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>At present, students in polytechnic institutions study anatomy and physiology
using interactive quizzes, videos, and stationary 3D models. However, many
students struggle to visualise human organ anatomy and physiology within
human body systems. To address this challenge, there is a growing utilization
of three-dimensional (3D) visualization technologies in enhancing anatomy
curricula, aiming to enhance comprehension of the intricate spatial relationships
inherent in the human body. In this study, we adopted one of these technologies
on mixed reality (MR) to teach anatomy with 3D images of human organs overlaid
with the physical environment. This present study aims to investigate the
impacts of virtual reality qualities, namely interaction (IT), imagination
(IG) and immersion (IM) on perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness
(PU) and behavioural intention to use (BI) HoloLens in a mixed reality
environment. Participants were 223 polytechnic students taking a module
on anatomy and physiology, and they participated in a HoloLens activity,
which was developed for the lesson on cardiovascular and lymphatic systems.
A cross-sectional quantitative research design was employed using an online
questionnaire with closed-ended questions. Six subscales on IT, IG, IM,
PEU, PU and BI were investigated. The results showed that IT, IG and IM
had significant correlations with PEU (.60 ≤ r ≤.66, p &lt; .01) and PU
(.69 ≤ r ≤.73, p &lt; .01). PEU and PU had significant correlations with
BI, i.e. r=.53 and r=.74 respectively, p &lt; .01. Regression analysis
showed that IG (β = .37, p&lt;.001) is the strongest significant predictor
of PEU, followed by IT (β = .26, p&lt;.01). For PU, IG (β = .34, p&lt;.001)
was also a significant predictor, followed by IT (β = .24, p&lt;.01) and
IM (β = .25, p &lt;.01). Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that
both PU (β = .45, p &lt; .001) and IM (β = .26, p &lt;.001) were significant
predictors of BI. The results of the study provided insights for educators
to better understand the qualities of virtual reality (VR) when using HoloLens
as an instructional activity. The implications of findings, study limitations,
and future research will be discussed in the paper.</p>
