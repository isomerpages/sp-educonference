<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In 2021, a new function, Reading Progress was added to Microsoft Teams.
Using this function, students record themselves reading out loud and those
recordings are automatically evaluated by an auto-detect system with artificial
intelligence. In 2022, assignments using this function were given to the
4th-grade students at a technology college twice in the author’s English
class. The results showed that Reading Progress can help students practice
reading passages aloud continuously and relieve their stress with reading,
although the evaluation was not always accurate. The following year, with
improvements based on the previous reading practice results, assignments
using the same function were given to 2nd-grade students ten times in the
author’s English class throughout the year. In this paper, the data from
student submissions is analysed, and the result of a questionnaire administered
to those students after the completion of the assignments is reported.
Based on the analysis and results, areas for improvement are suggested.</p>
<p>In all the assignments, students were asked to read passages from their
textbooks aloud and submit their best recordings on Microsoft Teams. According
to the analysis of assignments from 57 students, their accuracy rate varied
between 80 to 90 percent and their WPM (words per minute) were between
70 to 100. In addition, the number of mispronounced words was 12 on average.
Therefore, the selected passages and their lengths were appropriate considering
the English level of the students. However, their submission rate gradually
decreased as time passed.</p>
<p>Additionally, according to the questionnaire, approximately 70 percent
of the students had practiced reading the passages aloud before recording.
Moreover, approximately 65 percent of the students answered that they had
felt relaxed while recording and that this app helped them improve their
English pronunciation. Additionally, most students were quite satisfied
with its function and they answered that they could use this app with little
trouble. Contrary to these positive reactions, this app did not help relieve
anxiety and build confidence when students read passages aloud in front
of others. It is necessary to make improvements to enhance the students’
motivation and increase their enjoyment.</p>
