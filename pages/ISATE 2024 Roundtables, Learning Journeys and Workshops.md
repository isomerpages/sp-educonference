<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The aim of this roundtable is to delve into possible approaches for student
guidance through Collaborative Lectures between Polytechnic Schools and
NIT College.</p>
<p>Students today study in a different way than in the past, thanks to technological
advancements, particularly in the form of AI tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot,
Gemini, and so on. As such, there is a need to shift from the current one-way
imparting knowledge strategies to become two-ways or multiple ways, with
greater student involvement in the lecture components.</p>
<p>One of the key takeaways from this roundtable is to be a set of guiding
questions for each pair of participating institution’s planning and execution.
Also, the pedagogy aspect and methodologies involved will be brought up

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>RT09 (Ethical Considerations in the Integration of AI for Teaching and
Learning)</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a transformative influence in
the education industry, reshaping the delivery of teaching and learning.
It introduces both opportunities and challenges in this context. AI technologies,
exemplified by tools like ChatGPT, have the capacity to revolutionize the
creation of various content types, such as text, images, art, music, or
programming code. This can result in the development of dynamic and interactive
teaching materials designed to engage students more effectively. However,
the same AI tools could be misused to generate academic work, such as assignments
or final year reports, potentially leading to unethical behavior and academic
misconduct when used without proper declaration or authorization.</p>
<p>While AI technologies may pose a threat to academic integrity, they also
offer significant advantages. AI enhances users' capabilities, both positively
and negatively. Therefore, it is crucial for students and educators to
receive guidance on the benefits and limitations of AI technologies, enabling
ethical usage and upholding academic integrity. The objective is to strike
a balance between harnessing the transformative potential of AI and safeguarding
against unintended and unethical consequences. This requires collaborative
efforts among stakeholders, including educators, to establish comprehensive
frameworks aligning AI advancements with academic integrity, human values,
ethical standards, and societal expectations.</p>
<p>This roundtable session aims to foster discussions on ethical considerations
in the implementation of AI for teaching and learning.</p>
<p>The topics to be explored in this session include, but are not limited
to:</p>
<p>• An overview of various AI technologies for teaching and learning</p>
<p>• Potential academic threats and challenges associated with AI</p>
<p>• AI Ethics and Governance in Education</p>
<p>• Awareness of AI Ethics and Governance</p>
<p>• Tools and technologies for AI Ethics and Governance</p>

<p>Imagine a world where students are engaged in learning difficult subjects
and appreciate the value of what they are learning. In reality, students
are inundated with National Education (NE) messaging and current affairs
topics since young, and have the impression that such lessons are dull
and irrelevant to their lives.</p>
<p>Our team found a solution that is working for us. “Diplomats… in Space!”
is an innovative multiplayer card game that is designed to change this
impression by immersing students in strategic and thought-provoking Game-Based
Learning. Students will interact with game elements and gain insights into
how their decisions can affect the outcomes, which mirror scenarios and
events in the real world, as well as illustrate national and international
initiatives and frameworks.</p>

<summary>WS03 (App in a Jiffy - for Educators, Temasek Polytechnic (TP))</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In this workshop, participants will gain knowledge on how to develop a
secure and customizable mobile app using Microsoft Power Automate and Power
Apps.</p>
<p>Currently, for some of the academic, project, and student-related routine
tasks, human intervention is still necessary. Furthermore, the tasks are
time-consuming, require a lot of manpower, and must be repeated every semester.
The messages conveyed to the users––in the form of mass emails, reminders,
and warnings––are also not personalized.</p>
<p>By adopting end-to-end cloud automation platform technology in education,
repetitive tasks and personalized messages can be automated and sent to
users respectively. Additionally, less human intervention is required,
thereby saving man-hours, minimizing errors, and increasing scalability.
Furthermore, as this platform can be accessed anytime, anywhere, efficiency
and productivity are improved to new heights.</p>
<p>Pairing seamlessly with Power Automate, these tools become a powerhouse
for automation. Say goodbye to repetitive tasks and hello to newfound efficiency.</p>
