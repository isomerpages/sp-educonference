<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>RT 2 (Transforming Learning, Pedagogy, and Curriculum - A Competency-Based
Approach)</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The focus of this roundtable will be on shifting from traditional, content-driven
teaching methods to a competency-based approach, which emphasizes mastery
of skills and knowledge. The need to align curriculum with real-world competencies
demanded by employers and society will be discussed together with the importance
of fostering critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and creativity
skills, essential for success in the 21st-century workforce.</p>
<p>Key themes include personalized learning pathways tailored to individual
student needs, leveraging technology for interactive and immersive learning
experiences, and integrating real-world applications into the curriculum
to enhance relevance and engagement. Challenges such as standardization
versus flexibility, assessment methodologies, and teacher training will

<summary>RT03 (The BEVI (Beliefs, Events, and Values Inventory)</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Many engineering courses do not have a good measurement tool to track
students' progress in their beliefs and values. This roundtable discussion
will focus on the BEVI (Beliefs, Events, and Values Inventory), a robust
analytic tool spanning education, research and leadership. With over 30
years of research backing, BEVI offers a comprehensive understanding of
beliefs, values, and life events, fostering learning, growth, and transformation.</p>
<p>Participants will explore its adaptability, reliability, and applicability
across diverse settings, and delve into its theoretical underpinnings and
practical benefits. Let's discuss how BEVI can empower individuals, groups,
and organizations to navigate complex processes and outcomes, shaping a
path towards personal and collective development.</p>
<p>For more details on the BEVI, please go to: <a href="https://thebevi.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://thebevi.com</a>

<summary>RT04 (Collaborative Lectures between Polytechnic Schools and NIT Colleges)</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The aim of this roundtable is to delve into possible approaches for student
guidance through Collaborative Lectures between Polytechnic Schools and
NIT College.</p>
<p>Students today study in a different way than in the past, thanks to technological
advancements, particularly in the form of AI tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot,
Gemini, and so on. As such, there is a need to shift from the current one-way
imparting knowledge strategies to become two-ways or multiple ways, with
greater student involvement in the lecture components.</p>
<p>One of the key takeaways from this roundtable is to be a set of guiding
questions for each pair of participating institution’s planning and execution.
Also, the pedagogy aspect and methodologies involved will be brought up
for discussion as well.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>RT09 (Ethical Considerations in the Integration of AI for Teaching and
Learning)</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a transformative influence in
the education industry, reshaping the delivery of teaching and learning.
It introduces both opportunities and challenges in this context. AI technologies,
exemplified by tools like ChatGPT, have the capacity to revolutionize the
creation of various content types, such as text, images, art, music, or
programming code. This can result in the development of dynamic and interactive
teaching materials designed to engage students more effectively. However,
the same AI tools could be misused to generate academic work, such as assignments
or final year reports, potentially leading to unethical behavior and academic
misconduct when used without proper declaration or authorization.</p>
<p>While AI technologies may pose a threat to academic integrity, they also
offer significant advantages. AI enhances users' capabilities, both positively
and negatively. Therefore, it is crucial for students and educators to
receive guidance on the benefits and limitations of AI technologies, enabling
ethical usage and upholding academic integrity. The objective is to strike
a balance between harnessing the transformative potential of AI and safeguarding
against unintended and unethical consequences. This requires collaborative
efforts among stakeholders, including educators, to establish comprehensive
frameworks aligning AI advancements with academic integrity, human values,
ethical standards, and societal expectations.</p>
<p>This roundtable session aims to foster discussions on ethical considerations
in the implementation of AI for teaching and learning.</p>
<p>The topics to be explored in this session include, but are not limited
to:</p>
<p>• An overview of various AI technologies for teaching and learning</p>
<p>• Potential academic threats and challenges associated with AI</p>
<p>• AI Ethics and Governance in Education</p>
<p>• Awareness of AI Ethics and Governance</p>
<p>• Tools and technologies for AI Ethics and Governance</p>
</div>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>RT10 (Student engagement and first-year experience)</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The roundtable discussion will focus on the crucial topic of student engagement,
the first-year experience in studies, and strategies for supporting incoming
students to seamlessly integrate into the learning community. Recognizing
the pivotal role of the initial year in shaping students' learning path
and overall study experience, this discussion aims to explore innovative
approaches, best practices, and challenges in fostering student engagement
and facilitating a smooth transition for newcomers.</p>
<p>Participants are invited to discuss and share insights on orientation
programs, mentorship schemes, study support services, or any other practices
aiming at enhancing student retention, satisfaction, and success.</p>
<p>By addressing key issues and sharing practical solutions, this round table
