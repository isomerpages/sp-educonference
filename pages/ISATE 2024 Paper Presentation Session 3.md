<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Institute of Information Technology (HKIIT) has taken a
leading position in the rapidly changing Vocational and Professional Education
and Training (VPET) field by incorporating the cutting-edge conversational
AI into its Project-Based Learning (PBL) curriculum for students studying
software engineering. This study examines the prospective advantages and
difficulties of integrating ChatGPT to enhance problem-based learning facilitation
and assesses critically the precision and quality of its contributions
to diverse PBL roles.</p>
<p>ChatGPT's conversational attributes and capacity to imitate human interactions
apparently make it suitable for undertakings such as scenario conception,
facilitating discussions, responding to students' enquiries and offering
personalised advice to students. Its prompt feedback and information handling
abilities apparently can considerably diminish administrative burdens for
instructors, freeing up time for engaging with students, evaluating learning
outcomes and assessing student actual competencies.</p>
<p>However, incorporating ChatGPT also presents various challenges. Issues
emerge regarding liability in incidents of incorrect AI-generated information
and the actual accuracy of AI-generated result. In a learning environment
that relies seriously on the reliable information and guidance, ensuring
the trustworthiness of ChatGPT's output is crucial. This paper emphasises
the need for a balanced way to incorporating AI into teaching and learning.
As VPET continues adapts to technological progressions, technologies like
ChatGPT will apparently play a significant part in shaping the future of
learning. However, it is vital to address the difficulties connected with
their use to guarantee the quality and sincerity of the educational experience.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>This research study focuses on the integration of Generative Artificial
Intelligence (Gen AI) into the research process of design projects. The
study aims to enhance the learning experience for students in the Product
Technologies and System Design (PDTSD) module. It addresses the challenges
students face in traditional research methods, such as difficulty in sourcing
relevant information and time constraints due to other commitments. The
research employs an action research approach to introduce Gen AI tools,
specifically ChatGPT, in the early phases of project research and design
conceptualization. This intervention is applied to a cohort of year 2 students
in the Experiential Product &amp; Interior Design course (XPID), allowing
for a comparative analysis with a previous cohort that did not use Gen
AI tools. The study hypothesizes that Gen AI tools can facilitate a more
efficient research process, enabling students to obtain preliminary research
information rapidly, though they are still required to perform verification
and reflection to ensure the applicability of this information. Mixed methods
were used in the research, including surveys, interviews, and module feedback
ratings. The findings reveal a nuanced impact of AI tools on design education,
indicating a positive shift in learning experiences and increased acceptance
among students, while also highlighting a critical balance between enhancing
efficiency and nurturing creativity.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is changing the skills needed
in Data Science and education. This study looks at how GAI tools, like
ChatGPT and Codeium, can help students in a module that teaches machine
learning and applies it in decision-making. Initially, the module was too
challenging due to its heavy cognitive load, as indicated by feedback from
the 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 academic years. By using Codeium, programming
became easier and more intuitive, helping students understand complex ideas
better. ChatGPT offered personalized and interactive</p>
<p>support. Feedback from the 2023/2024 academic year showed higher student
satisfaction. This study shows that GAI tools can make learning easier
and could be used to teach other complex skills, reducing difficulty and
improving student skills for the future.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many students often express their dislike for writing and their perceived
lack of skill in it. Given that research has suggested a link between self-efficacy
and writing performance, we explored the potential of incorporating generative
AI (GAI) tools into a writing module at Singapore Polytechnic. This study
investigates the impact of introducing GAI tools on self-reported confidence
levels in writing and in use of GAI tools (UGAIT) for writing. In our study,
we introduced information on GAI, common AI writing tools, and benefits
and limitations of using GAI into existing teaching and learning materials
for the term-long Effective Writing for the Workplace (EWW) module. Participants
completed surveys at the start and end of the 6-week long module to assess
changes in self-reported confidence levels. We collected information on
students’ prior usage and perception of the usefulness of GAI tools in
writing assignments, and their confidence levels in writing in English
and in UGAIT to support their writing. Analysis of the data collected from
170 participants using the Wilcoxon signed rank test showed statistically
significant changes in self-reported confidence levels. The survey data
indicated increases in self-reported confidence levels in both UGAIT (40%)
and writing (36%). However, a minority of students reported decreased confidence
levels in both areas. Students who reported lower confidence in UGAIT expressed
distrust in GAI tools due to their current shortcomings and their own inadequate
AI literacy levels. Those who reported lower confidence in writing mostly
cited poor English grammar proficiency. Although applying the Spearman
rank correlation test did not show a statistically significant positive
association between UGAIT and writing confidence levels, our preliminary
study provides evidence of the potential benefits of incorporating GAI
tools into a writing module. In addition, our findings and further research
done in the process of doing the study, point to a need to provide more
structured guidance in the EWW module to improve student literacy levels
in UGAIT so our students can engage effectively and ethically with GAI
in a rapidly evolving world powered by large language models (LLM).</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Data hiding is a technology to embed secret messages to digital objects
without being recognized by human recognition systems. It includes digital
watermarking for copyright protection and digital fingerprinting to avoid
illegal copies or distributions of digital media as well as steganography
as a means of covert communications. The objects conveying the secret messages
are called “stego objects” while the original objects without carrying
any secret messages are called “cover objects.” In this study, we are only
concerned with data hiding schemes for printed matters. Specifically, we
develop applications to embed and extract secret messages from the digital
photographs or figures printed on the paper documents. We assume that the
embedded messages are URLs for digital learning materials on the web such
as audio files, videos as well as 3D models such as Sketchfab. Teachers
can embed such URLs into the digital files of figures or photographs on
their PCs with the developed embedding application. They can print learning
materials including these stego images conveying the embedded URLs and
distribute them to students. When students take a photo printed on the
distributed learning material by the developed extracting application installed
on digital devices, the embedded URLs will be automatically extracted and
the digital learning materials will be shown on the browser. In general,
the quality of the images printed on papers are deteriorated from that
of the original digital ones. It is difficult to extract the embedded messages
successfully from such deteriorated stego images. In the applications developed
in this study, we apply a data hiding scheme based on spatial synchronizations,
multiple embedding into middle frequency bands of the images as well as
error detecting codes. It has been shown that the developed application
can extract the embedded URLs with almost no errors, and we can operate
Sketchfab soon after we take the printed photos.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This paper discusses implementing a Digital Twin (DT) virtual model to
simulate scenarios impractical to recreate physically for the module ET0917:
PLC Applications in the School of Electrical &amp; Electronics</p>
<p>Engineering (SEEE). However, integrating DT into the lab involves numerous
steps potentially leading to cognitive overload for the students. To foster
sustainable learning, the lab activity design combines Self-Determination
Theory (SDT) and Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) to address both the motivational
and cognitive aspects so that students are not only motivated to learn
but also have the cognitive resources to do so effectively.</p>
<p>A mixed-methods approach including diverging stacked bar charts, sentiment
analysis of student comments, focus group discussions, and teaching staff
feedback was used to evaluate DT lab’s effectiveness. Data from 96 out
of 103 students and all four teaching staff over one semester indicate
positive reception. Both teaching staff and students reported there were
improved visualization and enhance learning experiences with the DT model.</p>
<p>The paper then suggests addressing the challenges and future research
to enhance learning for</p>
<p>sustainability, including an extended activity with a future carpark scenario.
Engaging in such activities</p>
<p>can help students anticipate how changes in problem and parameters affect
system behaviour, fostering</p>
<p>anticipatory competency, a key sustainability identified by UNESCO.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Nagaoka University of Technology (NUT) was established in 1976 as a leading
school for engineering studies. NUT was founded on a new idea called “GIGAKU
(Science of Technology).” This concept helps us find practical solutions
and sparks new ideas for the future. GIGAKU, related to STEM education,
uses a wide range of knowledge from science and engineering, management,
safety, information technology, and life sciences to come up with practical
solutions and innovations. NUT is one of the few universities in Japan
and abroad to have both a UNESCO Chair and a UNITWIN Network. The UNITWIN/UNESCO
Chairs Programme, established in 1992, aims to promote international cooperation
between universities, share knowledge, and encourage collaborative work.
Currently, there are around 950 UNESCO Chairs and 45 UNITWIN Networks across
120 countries and NUT has been established “UNESCO Chair on Engineering
Education for Sustainable Development (GIGAKU SDG Institute)” and “UNITWIN
Network for Engineering Education towards Sustainable Pathways (GIGAKU
SDG Network). GIGAKU SDG Network aims to be a place for making engineering
education better and more helpful in　achieving the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). This network is made up of 10 institutions from six　countries
(India, Mexico, Mongolia, Spain, Viet Nam, and Japan) and an observer company
from Thailand.　All members share the four Credos of the Network (Work integrated
learning, Early start and recurring　opportunity, Sustainable Development
Goals, and Evaluation by industry and society). Network members work together
to cultivate innovative engineers who have the practical skills needed
by their countries for　sustainable development. This is done through working
together on research, planning conferences together, and exchange programs
for students, staff, and faculty, among other things.</p>
<p>Network members have reached out to local communities, like high schools,
by making online educational materials in six languages (English, Japanese,
Spanish, Mongolian, Vietnamese, Thai) available on the website. Currently,
they are working on a multilingual textbook about engineering ethics. These
materials are used both inside and outside the network to help people worldwide
learn about practical engineering education more easily.</p>
<p>In the presentation, we will introduce the clear objective of the GIGAKU
SDG Network, along with examples of efforts to spread practical engineering
education/knowledge worldwide.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Temasek Polytechnic's Major Project is a Year 3 subject requiring students
to apply diploma-related skills in a real-world context. The course, worth
10 Credit Units, culminates in presentations to lecturers</p>
<p>after 10 weeks. Manual scheduling of these presentations is time-consuming
and leaves students limited preparation time. To address this, an automated
scheduling system using Artificial</p>
<p>Intelligence (AI) algorithms is proposed. The problem is approached as
a timetabling issue, considering hard (critical) and soft (non-critical)
constraints. Two AI algorithms, greedy algorithm and simulated annealing
(SA) were explored to solve this scheduling problem. Preliminary experiments</p>
<p>using a mock dataset showed that the SA algorithm successfully accommodates
all hard constraints and produces a higher-quality schedule. Based on these
results, the SA algorithm has been selected for implementation in the automated
scheduling system.</p>
