<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Institute of Information Technology (HKIIT) has taken a
leading position in the rapidly changing Vocational and Professional Education
and Training (VPET) field by incorporating the cutting-edge conversational
AI into its Project-Based Learning (PBL) curriculum for students studying
software engineering. This study examines the prospective advantages and
difficulties of integrating ChatGPT to enhance problem-based learning facilitation
and assesses critically the precision and quality of its contributions
to diverse PBL roles.</p>
<p>ChatGPT's conversational attributes and capacity to imitate human interactions
apparently make it suitable for undertakings such as scenario conception,
facilitating discussions, responding to students' enquiries and offering
personalised advice to students. Its prompt feedback and information handling
abilities apparently can considerably diminish administrative burdens for
instructors, freeing up time for engaging with students, evaluating learning
outcomes and assessing student actual competencies.</p>
<p>However, incorporating ChatGPT also presents various challenges. Issues
emerge regarding liability in incidents of incorrect AI-generated information
and the actual accuracy of AI-generated result. In a learning environment
that relies seriously on the reliable information and guidance, ensuring
the trustworthiness of ChatGPT's output is crucial. This paper emphasises
the need for a balanced way to incorporating AI into teaching and learning.
As VPET continues adapts to technological progressions, technologies like
ChatGPT will apparently play a significant part in shaping the future of
learning. However, it is vital to address the difficulties connected with
their use to guarantee the quality and sincerity of the educational experience.</p>

<summary>NYP_06 USE OF AI TOOLS IN THE RESEARCH PROCESS OF DESIGN PROJECTS TO ENHANCE
THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS</summary>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>This research study focuses on the integration of Generative Artificial
Intelligence (Gen AI) into the research process of design projects. The
study aims to enhance the learning experience for students in the Product
Technologies and System Design (PDTSD) module. It addresses the challenges
students face in traditional research methods, such as difficulty in sourcing
relevant information and time constraints due to other commitments. The
research employs an action research approach to introduce Gen AI tools,
specifically ChatGPT, in the early phases of project research and design
conceptualization. This intervention is applied to a cohort of year 2 students
in the Experiential Product &amp; Interior Design course (XPID), allowing
for a comparative analysis with a previous cohort that did not use Gen
AI tools. The study hypothesizes that Gen AI tools can facilitate a more
efficient research process, enabling students to obtain preliminary research
information rapidly, though they are still required to perform verification
and reflection to ensure the applicability of this information. Mixed methods
were used in the research, including surveys, interviews, and module feedback
ratings. The findings reveal a nuanced impact of AI tools on design education,
indicating a positive shift in learning experiences and increased acceptance
among students, while also highlighting a critical balance between enhancing
efficiency and nurturing creativity.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is changing the skills needed
in Data Science and education. This study looks at how GAI tools, like
ChatGPT and Codeium, can help students in a module that teaches machine
learning and applies it in decision-making. Initially, the module was too
challenging due to its heavy cognitive load, as indicated by feedback from
the 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 academic years. By using Codeium, programming
became easier and more intuitive, helping students understand complex ideas
better. ChatGPT offered personalized and interactive</p>
<p>support. Feedback from the 2023/2024 academic year showed higher student
satisfaction. This study shows that GAI tools can make learning easier
and could be used to teach other complex skills, reducing difficulty and
improving student skills for the future.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many students often express their dislike for writing and their perceived
lack of skill in it. Given that research has suggested a link between self-efficacy
and writing performance, we explored the potential of incorporating generative
AI (GAI) tools into a writing module at Singapore Polytechnic. This study
investigates the impact of introducing GAI tools on self-reported confidence
levels in writing and in use of GAI tools (UGAIT) for writing. In our study,
we introduced information on GAI, common AI writing tools, and benefits
and limitations of using GAI into existing teaching and learning materials
for the term-long Effective Writing for the Workplace (EWW) module. Participants
completed surveys at the start and end of the 6-week long module to assess
changes in self-reported confidence levels. We collected information on
studentsâ€™ prior usage and perception of the usefulness of GAI tools in
writing assignments, and their confidence levels in writing in English
and in UGAIT to support their writing. Analysis of the data collected from
170 participants using the Wilcoxon signed rank test showed statistically
significant changes in self-reported confidence levels. The survey data
indicated increases in self-reported confidence levels in both UGAIT (40%)
and writing (36%). However, a minority of students reported decreased confidence
levels in both areas. Students who reported lower confidence in UGAIT expressed
distrust in GAI tools due to their current shortcomings and their own inadequate
AI literacy levels. Those who reported lower confidence in writing mostly
cited poor English grammar proficiency. Although applying the Spearman
rank correlation test did not show a statistically significant positive
association between UGAIT and writing confidence levels, our preliminary
study provides evidence of the potential benefits of incorporating GAI
tools into a writing module. In addition, our findings and further research
done in the process of doing the study, point to a need to provide more
structured guidance in the EWW module to improve student literacy levels
in UGAIT so our students can engage effectively and ethically with GAI
in a rapidly evolving world powered by large language models (LLM).</p>
