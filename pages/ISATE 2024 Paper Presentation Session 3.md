<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Institute of Information Technology (HKIIT) has taken a
leading position in the rapidly changing Vocational and Professional Education
and Training (VPET) field by incorporating the cutting-edge conversational
AI into its Project-Based Learning (PBL) curriculum for students studying
software engineering. This study examines the prospective advantages and
difficulties of integrating ChatGPT to enhance problem-based learning facilitation
and assesses critically the precision and quality of its contributions
to diverse PBL roles.</p>
<p>ChatGPT's conversational attributes and capacity to imitate human interactions
apparently make it suitable for undertakings such as scenario conception,
facilitating discussions, responding to students' enquiries and offering
personalised advice to students. Its prompt feedback and information handling
abilities apparently can considerably diminish administrative burdens for
instructors, freeing up time for engaging with students, evaluating learning
outcomes and assessing student actual competencies.</p>
<p>However, incorporating ChatGPT also presents various challenges. Issues
emerge regarding liability in incidents of incorrect AI-generated information
and the actual accuracy of AI-generated result. In a learning environment
that relies seriously on the reliable information and guidance, ensuring
the trustworthiness of ChatGPT's output is crucial. This paper emphasises
the need for a balanced way to incorporating AI into teaching and learning.
As VPET continues adapts to technological progressions, technologies like
ChatGPT will apparently play a significant part in shaping the future of
learning. However, it is vital to address the difficulties connected with
their use to guarantee the quality and sincerity of the educational experience.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is changing the skills needed
in Data Science and education. This study looks at how GAI tools, like
ChatGPT and Codeium, can help students in a module that teaches machine
learning and applies it in decision-making. Initially, the module was too
challenging due to its heavy cognitive load, as indicated by feedback from
the 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 academic years. By using Codeium, programming
became easier and more intuitive, helping students understand complex ideas
better. ChatGPT offered personalized and interactive support. Feedback
from the 2023/2024 academic year showed higher student satisfaction. This
study shows that GAI tools can make learning easier and could be used to
teach other complex skills, reducing difficulty and improving student skills
for the future.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many students often express their dislike for writing and their perceived
lack of skill in it. Given that research has suggested a link between self-efficacy
and writing performance, we explored the potential of incorporating generative
AI (GAI) tools into a writing module at Singapore Polytechnic. This study
investigates the impact of introducing GAI tools on self-reported confidence
levels in writing and in use of GAI tools (UGAIT) for writing. In our study,
we introduced information on GAI, common AI writing tools, and benefits
and limitations of using GAI into existing teaching and learning materials
for the term-long Effective Writing for the Workplace (EWW) module. Participants
completed surveys at the start and end of the 6-week long module to assess
changes in self-reported confidence levels. We collected information on
students’ prior usage and perception of the usefulness of GAI tools in
writing assignments, and their confidence levels in writing in English
and in UGAIT to support their writing. Analysis of the data collected from
170 participants using the Wilcoxon signed rank test showed statistically
significant changes in self-reported confidence levels. The survey data
indicated increases in self-reported confidence levels in both UGAIT (40%)
and writing (36%). However, a minority of students reported decreased confidence
levels in both areas. Students who reported lower confidence in UGAIT expressed
distrust in GAI tools due to their current shortcomings and their own inadequate
AI literacy levels. Those who reported lower confidence in writing mostly
cited poor English grammar proficiency. Although applying the Spearman
rank correlation test did not show a statistically significant positive
association between UGAIT and writing confidence levels, our preliminary
study provides evidence of the potential benefits of incorporating GAI
tools into a writing module. In addition, our findings and further research
done in the process of doing the study, point to a need to provide more
structured guidance in the EWW module to improve student literacy levels
in UGAIT so our students can engage effectively and ethically with GAI
in a rapidly evolving world powered by large language models (LLM).</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Data hiding is a technology to embed secret messages to digital objects
without being recognized by human recognition systems. It includes digital
watermarking for copyright protection and digital fingerprinting to avoid
illegal copies or distributions of digital media as well as steganography
as a means of covert communications. The objects conveying the secret messages
are called “stego objects” while the original objects without carrying
any secret messages are called “cover objects.” In this study, we are only
concerned with data hiding schemes for printed matters. Specifically, we
develop applications to embed and extract secret messages from the digital
photographs or figures printed on the paper documents. We assume that the
embedded messages are URLs for digital learning materials on the web such
as audio files, videos as well as 3D models such as Sketchfab. Teachers
can embed such URLs into the digital files of figures or photographs on
their PCs with the developed embedding application. They can print learning
materials including these stego images conveying the embedded URLs and
distribute them to students. When students take a photo printed on the
distributed learning material by the developed extracting application installed
on digital devices, the embedded URLs will be automatically extracted and
the digital learning materials will be shown on the browser. In general,
the quality of the images printed on papers are deteriorated from that
of the original digital ones. It is difficult to extract the embedded messages
successfully from such deteriorated stego images. In the applications developed
in this study, we apply a data hiding scheme based on spatial synchronizations,
multiple embedding into middle frequency bands of the images as well as
error detecting codes. It has been shown that the developed application
can extract the embedded URLs with almost no errors, and we can operate
Sketchfab soon after we take the printed photos.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This paper discusses implementing a Digital Twin (DT) virtual model to
simulate scenarios impractical to recreate physically for the module ET0917:
PLC Applications in the School of Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering
(SEEE). However, integrating DT into the lab involves numerous steps potentially
leading to cognitive overload for the students. To foster sustainable learning,
the lab activity design combines Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Cognitive
Load Theory (CLT) to address both the motivational and cognitive aspects
so that students are not only motivated to learn but also have the cognitive
resources to do so effectively.</p>
<p>A mixed-methods approach including diverging stacked bar charts, sentiment
analysis of student comments, focus group discussions, and teaching staff
feedback was used to evaluate DT lab’s effectiveness. Data from 96 out
of 103 students and all four teaching staff over one semester indicate
positive reception. Both teaching staff and students reported there were
improved visualization and enhance learning experiences with the DT model.</p>
<p>The paper then suggests addressing the challenges and future research
to enhance learning for sustainability, including an extended activity
with a future carpark scenario. Engaging in such activities can help students
anticipate how changes in problem and parameters affect system behaviour,
fostering anticipatory competency, a key sustainability identified by UNESCO.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Nagaoka University of Technology (NUT) was established in 1976 as a leading
school for engineering studies. NUT was founded on a new idea called “GIGAKU
(Science of Technology).” This concept helps us find practical solutions
and sparks new ideas for the future. GIGAKU, related to STEM education,
uses a wide range of knowledge from science and engineering, management,
safety, information technology, and life sciences to come up with practical
solutions and innovations. NUT is one of the few universities in Japan
and abroad to have both a UNESCO Chair and a UNITWIN Network. The UNITWIN/UNESCO
Chairs Programme, established in 1992, aims to promote international cooperation
between universities, share knowledge, and encourage collaborative work.
Currently, there are around 950 UNESCO Chairs and 45 UNITWIN Networks across
120 countries and NUT has been established “UNESCO Chair on Engineering
Education for Sustainable Development (GIGAKU SDG Institute)” and “UNITWIN
Network for Engineering Education towards Sustainable Pathways (GIGAKU
SDG Network). GIGAKU SDG Network aims to be a place for making engineering
education better and more helpful in　achieving the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). This network is made up of 10 institutions from six　countries
(India, Mexico, Mongolia, Spain, Viet Nam, and Japan) and an observer company
from Thailand.　All members share the four Credos of the Network (Work integrated
learning, Early start and recurring　opportunity, Sustainable Development
Goals, and Evaluation by industry and society). Network members work together
to cultivate innovative engineers who have the practical skills needed
by their countries for　sustainable development. This is done through working
together on research, planning conferences together, and exchange programs
for students, staff, and faculty, among other things.</p>
<p>Network members have reached out to local communities, like high schools,
by making online educational materials in six languages (English, Japanese,
Spanish, Mongolian, Vietnamese, Thai) available on the website. Currently,
they are working on a multilingual textbook about engineering ethics. These
materials are used both inside and outside the network to help people worldwide
learn about practical engineering education more easily.</p>
<p>In the presentation, we will introduce the clear objective of the GIGAKU
SDG Network, along with examples of efforts to spread practical engineering
education/knowledge worldwide.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Temasek Polytechnic's Major Project is a Year 3 subject requiring students
to apply diploma-related skills in a real-world context. The course, worth
10 Credit Units, culminates in presentations to lecturers after 10 weeks.
Manual scheduling of these presentations is time-consuming and leaves students
limited preparation time. To address this, an automated scheduling system
using Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms is proposed. The problem
is approached as a timetabling issue, considering hard (critical) and soft
(non-critical) constraints. Two AI algorithms, greedy algorithm and simulated
annealing (SA) were explored to solve this scheduling problem. Preliminary
experiments using a mock dataset showed that the SA algorithm successfully
accommodates all hard constraints and produces a higher-quality schedule.
Based on these results, the SA algorithm has been selected for implementation
in the automated scheduling system.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Singapore Polytechnic (SP), our modules have become fully flipped.
Students in the flipped classroom view online lecture videos asynchronously
in our learning management system Brightspace (BS) as part of their pre-class
homework. Currently in BS, lecturers can only see if students have clicked
on the link to watch these assigned videos, but not the behaviour of the
students’ video viewing patterns. As lecturers, it is crucial to know our
students’ video watching habits so that we can identify their learning
needs before going to class. Therefore, in the School of Mathematics and
Science (MS), we embarked on a project to study this.</p>
<p>In this paper, we will share with you our insights in using video clickstream
data from an online system called LearningANTS for better classroom engagement.
This study was conducted in AY2023/24 S2 for the Engineering Mathematics
II module taken by approximately 840 students. During this semester, students
watched 3 weeks of lecture videos from LearningANTS where their various
click actions were being captured by the system. From the various reporting
charts in LearningANTS, lecturers were able to ascertain the percentage
of videos viewed by students and monitor when and how students played,
rewound, fast-forwarded and paused the videos as they watched the online
lessons.</p>
<p>Our findings from this study were gathered from data captured in the system
and feedback solicited through surveys from students and lecturers. Clustering
of the data with students’ assessment results enabled lecturers to better
understand video viewing behaviour based on the capabilities of students.
Feedback from student surveys helped lecturers better understand why students
rewound, fast-forwarded and paused the videos. The collective views from
lecturer surveys were generally positive. Although most lecturers agreed
that the insights gathered from the dashboard in the system can help improve
students’ learning, there is a need for better support in translating these
insights to classroom intervention strategies. As SP plans to roll out
video content management system in our modules, we can leverage our findings
to guide future deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In Japan, from the 2020 school year, programming education in elementary
schools has become compulsory. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports,
Science and Technology (MEXT) has proposed the "GIGA School Concept," which
has led to the rapid construction of ICT environments at each educational
institution, resulting in the steady introduction of programming education
and a wealth of examples. On the other hand, the current situation is that
programming education has not yet taken root due to the fact that there
are educational institutions with inadequate ICT environment facilities
and teachers who are concerned about how to conduct classes. Therefore,
we attempted to develop IoT-based programming education support materials
that are easy to use for both children and teachers, and that are also
easy to introduce in terms of environmental facilities. We developed a
teaching material to support programming education by applying IoT technology.
By creating 3D programming blocks with ‘Basic programing source code’ and
combining them to construct a program, and by transmitting the information
of the assembled programming blocks to the robot side, the robot equipped
with a microcontroller can operate according to the assembled blocks, and
the results of the program execution can be fed back to the robot side.
Specifically, the basic operation of the robot is assigned to each block,
and an operation program is constructed as a combination of basic operations
from the array information of each block read by the master block. The
created program is transferred to the robot by Bluetooth wireless communication,
and the robot actually performs the operation defined by the array of blocks.
This system is designed to allow you to enjoy trial and error by actually
moving your hands to assemble the blocks. The purpose of this system is
to improve the learning efficiency by providing feedback to the robot.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The integration of learning analytics in flipped classroom involves gathering
and analysing data on student engagement, performance and learning behaviours
from both pre-class and in-class activities. The use of data, whether it
is explanatory or through predictive models, is to gain insights to improve
student learning outcomes (Pam, A et al, 2016). This study explores the
utilisation of learning analytics within the Brightspace Learning Management
System (LMS) for Chemistry I module, where students engage with diverse
resources and activities, including asynchronous lectures, assignments,
quizzes and surveys. Analysis of data is facilitated by the Quiz Dashboard
with a specific focus on investigating the impact of students’ pre-class
assignment score on mid-semester test (MST), examination and their overall
module marks. The purpose is to gain insights into how students’ interaction
with their pre-class assignments will allow faculty to determine learners’
motivation and predict their examination and overall module performance.
Our results showed that there is a significant positive correlation between
the total pre-class assignment score and the examination marks, r (515)
= .68, p &lt; .05. There is also a strong positive correlation between
the total pre-class assignment score and the final module marks and the
relationship is also statistically significant, r (515) = .73, p &lt; .05.
Our analysis also showed that students in the higher pre-class assignment
percentage ranges have a higher percentage of learners passing the MST
and the examination. The results are encouraging as it validated the use
of data from pre-class assignment score in Brightspace as ALeRT to help
students improve on their chemistry. The data can also be used to predict
at-risk students early so that faculty can provide targeted interventions
through differentiated activities or supplementary classes to support their
learning journey. This approach aligns with the broader goal of leveraging
technology and data to optimise students’ learning and allow faculty members
to create a more inclusive and effective learning environment in chemistry
education.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Delivery classes have been conducting delivery classes for teachers at
Kyoto Prefectural Special Support School. The content of the classes consists
of switch teaching devices, which are often requested by teachers at special-needs
schools. With the recent introduction of mandatory programming education,
there has been a demand for assistive products related to programming knowledge.
One such request originated from a teacher at a special-needs school for
children with physical disabilities, who said, “I want to use virtual reality
to realize things that cannot be done in the real world.” This can be challenging
for people with disabilities. Therefore, in this study, we propose switch
assistive technology that enables people with severe disabilities to operate
virtual reality (VR) in the same way as those without disabilities. We
developed a controller that enables physically impaired people to operate
VR. This controller consists of switches that are typically used by people
with a physical handicap. This switch can be used to switch the user's
viewpoint in the VR environment. We confirmed that a person with a physical
handicap can operate the VR in the same way as a person without a physical
handicap.</p>

<p>This paper reviews the process, products and outcomes of the Kosen Global
Camp implemented by National Institute of Technology, Akashi college in
September 2023 under Sakura Science Grant. This 10- day program invited
international college students as well as globally experienced lecturers
and provided a series of active learning and problem-based workshops on
disaster science, climate change preparedness, climate-related disaster
innovation, and engineering design. The aim was to devise the youth in
inclusive understanding of climate change related disaster risks and encourage
their innovative and critical thinking through multicultural and multi-discipline
to prepare and respond to future risks. Throughout Kosen Global Camp, students
at college of technologies from Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, and
Mongolia, gathered in Akashi College of Technology and developed their
ideas as to face climate-related disasters as innovative product prototypes.
Participants were given lectures on basics of natural hazards and climate-related
disasters, practiced different risk scenarios as the survivors as well
as preparedness innovators. In addition, students were assigned to 6 multicultural
groups of international students to introduce and establish a deep understanding
of the natural hazards in their home countries for other members and discuss
the challenges of climate change in each background. The members then worked
along the engineering design lectures, captured a global discussion and
way of thinking regarding the issues of climate change and developed their
very own creative prototype of products. At the end, each group presented
their prototype for the participants and the lecturers and were awarded
a certificate of completion. We believe that these types of youth innovative
and active education followed by problem-based learning techniques will
enhance next generations understanding and familiarity with the basics
of climate change related disaster. In addition, the participants can develop
a better understanding of their role and ability as contributors to mitigate
the risks and damages more globally in the future.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This paper documents an innovation in which a customized learning assistant
chatbot, built upon the Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), a Generative
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Model (LLM), was employed as
a virtual tutor to supplement the student learning experience in a data-enabled
flipped learning (DEFL) classroom module. The research sought to explore,
analyse, and evaluate how students experienced this technology, what could
be learned to enhance different aspects of the learning process, and the
challenges this may pose for future practice and research. The pedagogic
approach was guided by an evidence-based teaching framework in which the
design and facilitation of learning draws on validated knowledge on how
students learn best and what teaching methods are most effective and efficient.
In the chatbot, students were provided with clear learning outcomes, instructional
content that focused on the key subject concepts essential to building
understanding, and focused question prompts to initiate their critical
thinking. They were then encouraged to use their own initiative in experimenting
with this AI technology. The methodology involved data collection from
146 first-year students across eight classes in two Digital Electronics
modules, focus group interviews with a sample of 10 students, and reflective
practices from three teaching faculty. The research yielded positive results,
especially on the usefulness of the virtual learning assistant chatbot
pre-trained on the module content. It significantly enhanced students'
understanding by providing rapid and accurate feedback. It was also deemed
effective for supporting various learning tasks, such as answering questions,
offering explanations, and generating insights. By understanding students’
perceptions, based on their learning experiences with the chatbot, faculty
can create instructional strategies to enhance the quality of their teaching
practices. This also offers the potential for greater differentiation and
personalization of instruction, which is a highly desirable educational
aim.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>The National Institute of Technology (KOSEN), Kure College (KC) which
was opened in 1964, will celebrate its 60th anniversary in 2024. The growing
social demand for female participation in the engineering field led KC
to establish Gender Equality Promotion Office in 2013. Since then, a female
student public relations group has operated as a subordinate organization
of the Gender Equality Promotion Office, aiming to promote diversity within
KC. In 2015, the group changed its name to MECA Girls Training Project,
with “MECA” representing Mechanical, Electrical, Information Science, Civil
and Architectural Engineering. This project has been ongoing, designing
various science and engineering-related workshops and promotional events.
Its goal is to help junior high school students choose scientific fields
as their career paths and to raise awareness of KOSEN as one of the viable
options. As a result of these efforts, the average percentage of female
students in admission, which was about 15 % before the inception of MECA
Girls Training Project, has significantly increased to an average of 24
% between 2015 and 2024. As of the year 2024, it has reached its highest
point at 32 %, surpassing the mid-term target for KOSEN female enrollment
by two points. The present study focuses on the process of building campus
organizations and educational program to enhance the competency level of
female students. Furthermore, we will look at how the project-based course,
“Incubation Work,” which started in 2015 for all grades and in all departments
in KC, has influenced the deepening of the project themes female students
devised. Then, the questionnaire survey conducted on the project members
is analysed to see what capacities were built through the project implementation.
In conclusion, it can be said that several essential skills and abilities
to seek careers, that is, communication skills, self-analytical skills,
and promotional ability were fostered through the creation of science and
engineering educational content for junior high school students and promotional
activities to increase the number of female students entering KOSEN. Finally,
some methodological insights that will contribute to expanding the base
of science career choice support programs are suggested.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The ability to achieve an optimum design based on specifications is a
skill that should be developed in the mechanical engineering program. We
have developed a “self-enlightenment” engineering educational scheme for
designing, creating, and evaluating through the spontaneous participation
of students themselves. The most significant feature is providing experiences
such as machining to create “real (not virtual)” parts to assemble and
form real products with one’s own hands. Achieving this goal requires students
to repeat the design cycle (CAD-CAE) to avoid any mistakes in the final
products produced by CAM. Evaluating the final product can reveal how well
the design cycle worked yet you may find some unexpected things and why
that happens. In recent years, we used a “smartphone stand” as the targeted
product and the instructors providing the specifications to third-year
undergraduate students in Department of Mechanical Engineering, Toyohashi
University of Technology. Students designed and analyzed using 3D-CAD and
created component drawings. Through analyses (e.g. CAE; evaluating stress
distribution and overall shape deformation), an optimal design was determined,
and students evaluated its feasibility of their design. If not satisfied,
they were encouraged to modify the design in 3D-CAD and then analyze again.
By repeating this cycle (CAD-CAE), students learn the optimization process
in design, which is often experienced in the real manufacturing processes.
Once the shapes of all parts were finalized, the CAD data was transferred
to a laser cutter device (CAM), which cuts thick paper to manufacture the
designed parts. Students assembled the parts to create their own smartphone
stands, then evaluated them in various ways to check whether they satisfied
the prescribed specifications. Generally, products do not match all specifications,
thus students consider the reasons for inconsistencies and areas for improvement,
which enhances awareness of the important aspects of engineering design.
By adopting the problem-solving and repetitive learning method using the
CAD-CAM-CAE cycle, students can improve their ability to become future
professional engineers in an efficient yet effective manner.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The upsurge of digital technology after the global pandemic has completely
transformed the world around us, and its impact on the educational sector
has been remarkable. With the incessant progress of digital technology,
numerous technology-assisted learning platforms have been developed. Among
them, mobile phone learning platforms are grabbing attention as most of
the students have easier access to mobile phones than any other digital
tools. Previous studies have shown that various mobile-assisted learning
(MALL) methods are being utilized to learn and teach different courses
in educational institutions around the world. However, there are limited
studies reporting the effectiveness of MALLs particularly in the colleges
of the National Institute of Technology, known as KOSEN. In this study,
the objective was to conduct a preliminary study to explore the effectiveness
of MALL as a new teaching approach in order to motivate them and provide
an engaging learning environment. For this study, the chosen participants
were the second-year KOSEN students. They were divided into treatment and
control groups. In general, majority of the students find vocabulary challenging
to remember in an English reading course. So, they were given grammar and
vocabulary assignments and tests using a mobile application called Monoxer.
The performance of students was assessed through their pre-tests and post-tests.
Further, questionnaire studies were conducted to understand the perceptions
of students about MALL and its impact on their performance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was observed that the students’ experiences using the MALL for English
reading course were affirmative. They were satisfied by this new approach
of learning and found it effective for improving their reading comprehension
in English reading course. Besides, the students accepted the application
of the MALL app based on its usefulness, ease of use and access, instant
feedback from teachers, and continuity. For the efficiency assessment,
when the treatment group was compared with the control group, the treatment
group outperformed the control group on their academic performance for
English reading course. Therefore, this study verifies that MALL could
be an effective pedagogical tool for promoting English reading comprehension
competency in KOSEN.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>E-learning/online learning based on the virtual learning environment (VLE)
has become a viable education alternative, gaining more and more attention
due to its flexibility, accessibility, cost effectiveness, customized learning
experience, and variety of courses available. In Republic Polytechnic (RP),
e-learning has been deliberately planned and carefully designed to provide
alternative learning options. For Continuing Education and Training (CET)
full qualification diploma programmes, e-learning has been increasingly
promoted and significantly ramped up in recent years. Therefore, it is
important to know if students would have similar learning experiences and
achieve equivalent course outcomes in e-learning as in Face-to-Face learning.
This study explored the factors affecting the course outcomes in e-learning
based on students’ perceptions of e-learning experience. Quantitative methods
encompassing a 10-factor, 30-item survey were employed in this study. Factor
and reliability analyses were conducted to verify, validate and refine
the survey items. Survey responses were analysed through descriptive, comparative
and correlational analyses. Survey findings were derived to summarize students’
overall perceptions of e-learning (descriptive), differences in perceptions
of e-learning across different semesters (comparative), and relationships
between the various factors and their influences on the e-learning course
outcomes (correlational). The findings showed that, it is important to
enhance learner-content interactions through building interactive activities
into the e-learning package; to ensure the e-learning packages have clear
instructions, proper workload, and easy access; to increase interactions
(learner-learner, learner-lecturer) through online discussions and activities
to promote social presence during e-learning; and to adopt microlearning
for learners to absorb information before they lose interest or attention,
which in turn increases knowledge retention.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In the post-COVID era, the Learning Express (LeX) programme underwent
two significant transformations: a shift from social innovation to sustainable
innovation, aligning with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), and its transition into an Asia-Ready Exposure (AEP) programme.
The latter aims to foster students' continued interest in the ASEAN, China
and India (ACI) region, extending learning beyond LeX by championing sustainability
within these regions. However, with these two transformations, the cornerstone
of the programme is still Authentic Learning, by which our students are
engaged as active problem-solver and inquirers. Therefore, this paper investigates
the key features that contribute to the authenticity of learning in the
refined LeX programme and its extension, LeXPlus.</p>
<p>Employing a mixed-methods approach, the study conducted a preliminary
survey to assess the authenticity of learning within the ACI region and
interviewed a student and a facilitator to gain insights into how learning
occurs within and beyond LeX, with a specific focus on Authentic Learning
in the context of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). The findings
revealed that while students possessed baseline knowledge of the interplay
between ESD elements, the application of this knowledge can be primarily
observed beyond LeX. Furthermore, the role of the facilitator emerged as
crucial in championing sustainability during LeX.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, the paper provides recommendations to enhance
the authenticity of learning in LeX and LeXPlus, contributing to the broader
goal of promoting sustainable development within the ACI region while preparing
our students to become proactive global citizens of the world.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Traditional Japanese education was a passive, instruction-based system
of teaching knowledge. The current approach to Science, Technology, Engineering,
Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) education, by contrast, is of a construction
type (PBL), inviting active learning. The approach to STEAM education is
recognized as an important goal of national reform in Japanese education
from kindergarten to university (K–16). However, in Japan, STEAM education
has only received implementation over the past few years, such that there
is little knowledge available on STEAM learning programs, curriculum models,
and assessment methods. We developed a method for programming LED illuminations
within STEAM education to enhance fundamental competencies and creativity
in K–16 students. First, we created web applications using “BIPES“ and
developed “MicroPython IDE“ to create a programming environment for STEAM
education that involved LED illuminations that do not require software
installation. BIPES is a visual programming tool, similar to Scratch and
MicroPython IDE; it is a code programming tool for the MicroPython language.
Furthermore, in using these programming environments, we created teaching
materials to enable hands-on learning of programming from an artistic perspective.
We investigated several aspects of this teaching material, including its
appeal to children, enjoyment level, its comparability with Scratch, and
the motivational aspect it offers for programming learning. The programming
course, that used teaching materials for STEAM, greatly boosted student
motivation to learn programming. This finding indicates high levels of
satisfaction with this teaching material, likely due to the novelty and
joy of being able to control everyday items, such as push-button switch,
speaker, and LED, which sparked the interest and curiosity of the students.
Furthermore, we implemented education using LED illuminations at “Tottori
Hanakairo” for fifth-year students at a technical college. These students
applied their knowledge to plan and design LED illumination projects and
to create electrical circuits and programming. This initiative, in which
students themselves put their ideas into practice and learn by cycling
between Input (Knowledge) and Output (Creativity), has notably enhanced
students’ motivation to learn.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Entrepreneurship is recognized as one of the methods of student empowerment
in KOSEN education. Various KOSENs have been challenged to develop “student
entrepreneurs” from the education program and startup competitions. However,
most Japanese small companies have made various innovations through KOSEN
alumni. These innovations have certainly supported the development potential
of Japanese industries directly or indirectly. We focus on developing human
resources in KOSEN as “future intrapreneurs” in small companies for Japanese
industrial development. An education model was constructed as a form of
the “theme-finding internship (TFI)” program. The framework of the TFI
program was conceptualized as follows: first, we constructed student teams
of three students from other backgrounds; second, the student teams challenged
hidden problems in the proposed tasks suggested by a company; third, academic
staff members supported and picked up essential tasks from students/company
discussions from scientific viewpoints; and third, the company agreed to
support students financially and in terms of career design via future employment.</p>
<p>During vacation in 2023, we endeavored to create a proof of concept for
the TFI programs with three companies in Tokyo, Japan. These companies
have faced potential problems with environmental issues such as a circular
economy, low carbon footprint, and so on.</p>
<p>We found that each student group generated excellent ideas and future
tasks only within a five-day internship. As one of the achievements, a
student team developed an image processing algorithm to detect specific
polymers, such as polyvinyl chloride, by indicating specific colors from
the view of the smart glasses. Other examples include a production process
of low-carbon lime resources from unused alkaline chemicals in wastewater
from washing returnable glass bottles and a management system of reused
laptop computers based on lifetime prediction. This presentation summarizes
the effects and outputs of KOSEN students via the TFI program with small
companies.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>While classroom teaching used to be more didactic practice with students
listening passively, the scenario has changed ever since the Flipped Learning
(FL) approach was adopted. Teaching &amp; Learning practices and strategies
have shifted over the years from instructor-led learning to a more constructive
and collaborative experience so that students can be active and engaged
participants of learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>FL allows students to take ownership of learning. Research has shown that
FL has a positive impact on students as they learn to exercise the autonomy
they are given to decide where and when learning takes place as well as
how deep and far they would like to learn the content on their own. This
is in line with the psychology of today’s youth who prefer autonomy in
decision-making. (R. Brewer and S. Movahedazarhouligh, 2018).</p>
<p></p>
<p>FL was formally adopted at Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP), School of Business
&amp; Accountancy (BA) in 2022 when the curriculum was redesigned to include
Online Asynchronous Learning (OAL). Students are to engage with the required
self-access learning materials and pre-activities made available to them
through the Learning Management System (LMS) before attending the In-Person
Lessons (IPL). Currently, at BA, the curriculum ratio of online asynchronous
learning and in-person learning is on average 40:60.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This paper compares the similarities and differences in the design elements
of each module, the challenges encountered, and the next steps to enhance
the FL experience for two BA modules: User-Centered Design for Business
(UCBD), taken by all 1st year BA students, and Digitalisation and Data
Analytics 2 (DDA2), taken by all 2nd year Accountancy students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Both UCDB and DDA2 were re-conceptualised and re-designed as FL modules
which incorporate elements that enable students to engage in more self-directed
learning and lecturers to be able to regularly view and monitor students’
learning and progress. It is notable that whilst the content of both modules
is different and UCDB and DDA2 cater to different levels of BA students,
the adoption of FL in both modules is to achieve the same objective of
a more learner-centered learning experience that shapes self-directed habits
in learners. Apart from the LMS, both modules leverage on a range of purposefully
selected education technology tools such as Feedback Fruits, Padlet and
Articulate Rise to enhance the FL experience, thereby increasing the engagement
and motivation of students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Responses to the FL experience have been positive for both modules. Students
were generally happy with the way the learning materials were designed
and facilitated. Students also felt positive about how the connection between
the OAL and IPL components of FL were scaffolded to help them deepen their
understanding and to apply their learning. A Module Experience Survey was
conducted with both modules achieving strong positive average scores of
5.43 for DDA2 and 5.11 for UCDB against a total possible score of 6.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL) is committed
to developing practical and creative engineers through education rooted
in real-life challenges. The curriculum is strategically designed to equip
students from their first year to their fifth year with progressive hands-on
learning experiences emphasizing individual and collaborative skills. In
the initial years, first-year students learn essential thinking and project
execution skills through tools like Venn diagrams, mind maps, and Gantt
charts, alongside feasibility studies and analysis to assess strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Beginning in the third year, these
foundational skills are vital for problem-based and project-based learning
(PBL). Here, students apply their accumulated knowledge to solve practical
problems assigned in groups, enhancing their ability to research independently
using various sources, including the internet. By the fourth year, the
focus shifts to real-world applications, with students undertaking projects
directly sourced from industry partners. This collaboration continues into
the fifth year, where students engage in internships and graduation projects
that confront actual industry challenges, offering a robust experiential
learning environment. This process affects not only the product but also
the project execution skills of the students. Faculty and industry experts
closely mentor and evaluate the students, ensuring a comprehensive learning
experience that meets educational goals and prepares students for professional
success.</p>
