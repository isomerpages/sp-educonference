<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The rapid evolution of machine learning applications has put a light on
the need to provide KOSEN students with the appropriate tools to understand
and experience this field of engineering. With this in mind, we have developed
a core design approach for a series of experiments that most KOSEN schools
can easily adopt and that are easy to adapt to the constant changes in
trends in the field of machine learning. This design approach focuses on
experiments being easy to reproduce and maintain along KOSEN institutions
as follows. Reproducibility: Experiments can be implemented with tools
that are widely available to most KOSEN students and academic staff. We
kept hardware costs and requirements as affordable and simple as possible
to ensure that the proposed experiments can be put together without a major
investment of time or money. Sustainability: By using free online computing
platforms, all the resources needed to train, implement and test the often
resource-heavy machine learning models are provided by a powerful online
server at no additional cost, thus reducing the need to buy and maintain
expensive equipment such as graphic cards or robots.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With these two points as the core of our design philosophy, we present
the design of a series of experiments planned over three sessions of 4.5
hours each, focused on providing practical experience in image processing
and image recognition. On each session, students work autonomously through
a python notebook on Google Colaboratory to understand the basics of each
session by running already prepared code that is heavily commented. Then,
students face a series of challenges that put to test what they learned
during the session. As a result from this experiment design, students were
able to learn and use concepts related to image processing to solve problems
in a flexible and independent way. For our study case, it was observed
that, in average, students took over 1.5 hours to go through and understand
the examples and around 3 hours to solve the challenges and developed a
sense of understanding of the topics discussed on each session.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This paper presents an action research study focused on recommending an
effective Classroom of the Future (CotF) for collaborative learning (CL)
with a key emphasis on low-cost design. The research examines student feedback
on the CotF and instructional tools used to enhance learning, focusing
on supporting active learning spaces. Challenges encountered in setting
up the CotF for effective CL implementation are documented.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lecturers and Students' feedback indicates a positive reception of the
CotF, reporting enhanced learning experiences facilitated by integrated
instructional tools. Through qualitative and quantitative data analysis,
the study evaluates the impact of CotF design on student engagement, collaboration,
and learning outcomes. Challenges related to spatial arrangement, technological
infrastructure, and instructional support are addressed through design
iterations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Key findings underscore the importance of group seating arrangements,
technology-just right environments, and tailored instructional strategies
to foster collaborative learning experiences in the CotF. The research
contributes to the discourse on simple innovative learning environments,
emphasizing the significance of intentional space design in higher education
settings, while also highlighting the necessity of cost-effective.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In conclusion, the paper offers recommendations for optimizing CotF configurations
to support CL pedagogy based on empirical insights and best practices in
educational design, with a particular emphasis on low-cost solutions. By
providing a framework for CotF implementation aligned with established
educational principles, the study highlights the transformative potential
of affordable, innovative learning spaces in facilitating student-centered,
collaborative learning experiences.</p>
