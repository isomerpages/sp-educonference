<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The rapid evolution of machine learning applications has put a light on
the need to provide KOSEN students with the appropriate tools to understand
and experience this field of engineering. With this in mind, we have developed
a core design approach for a series of experiments that most KOSEN schools
can easily adopt and that are easy to adapt to the constant changes in
trends in the field of machine learning. This design approach focuses on
experiments being easy to reproduce and maintain along KOSEN institutions
as follows. Reproducibility: Experiments can be implemented with tools
that are widely available to most KOSEN students and academic staff. We
kept hardware costs and requirements as affordable and simple as possible
to ensure that the proposed experiments can be put together without a major
investment of time or money. Sustainability: By using free online computing
platforms, all the resources needed to train, implement and test the often
resource-heavy machine learning models are provided by a powerful online
server at no additional cost, thus reducing the need to buy and maintain
expensive equipment such as graphic cards or robots.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With these two points as the core of our design philosophy, we present
the design of a series of experiments planned over three sessions of 4.5
hours each, focused on providing practical experience in image processing
and image recognition. On each session, students work autonomously through
a python notebook on Google Colaboratory to understand the basics of each
session by running already prepared code that is heavily commented. Then,
students face a series of challenges that put to test what they learned
during the session. As a result from this experiment design, students were
able to learn and use concepts related to image processing to solve problems
in a flexible and independent way. For our study case, it was observed
that, in average, students took over 1.5 hours to go through and understand
the examples and around 3 hours to solve the challenges and developed a
sense of understanding of the topics discussed on each session.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This research study focuses on the integration of Generative Artificial
Intelligence (Gen AI) into the research process of design projects. The
study aims to enhance the learning experience for students in the Product
Technologies and System Design (PDTSD) module. It addresses the challenges
students face in traditional research methods, such as difficulty in sourcing
relevant information and time constraints due to other commitments. The
research employs an action research approach to introduce Gen AI tools,
specifically ChatGPT, in the early phases of project research and design
conceptualization. This intervention is applied to a cohort of year 2 students
in the Experiential Product &amp; Interior Design course (XPID), allowing
for a comparative analysis with a previous cohort that did not use Gen
AI tools. The study hypothesizes that Gen AI tools can facilitate a more
efficient research process, enabling students to obtain preliminary research
information rapidly, though they are still required to perform verification
and reflection to ensure the applicability of this information. Mixed methods
were used in the research, including surveys, interviews, and module feedback
ratings. The findings reveal a nuanced impact of AI tools on design education,
indicating a positive shift in learning experiences and increased acceptance
among students, while also highlighting a critical balance between enhancing
efficiency and nurturing creativity.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Mathematics is typically taught in isolation, with students needing to
comprehend the mathematical concepts and processes before they can solve
problems, often working independently. Students often get “stuck” at certain
processes and would not be able to proceed if their doubts are not clarified.
For weaker students, this experience can be frustrating and challenging
as they struggle to find the correct solution. Consequently, many of them
would lose motivation to study the subject.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Barkley, Major and Cross (2014) noted that collaborative learning encourages
students to work together to tackle difficult learning challenges and to
learn from one another. This study aimed to observe students’ learning
experience in Smart Classrooms and gather insights into how tutors utilise
the Smart Classroom features to enhance collaborative learning. The participants
in this study are Year 1 students enrolled in the module Engineering Mathematics
2 (EM2) at Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In October 2023 semester, all EM2 lessons were taught in Smart Classrooms.
This allowed lecturers to design learning activities that would enable
students to work as a group to discuss and solve mathematics problems.
Students interacted with the touchscreens through annotations and screen
casting one group’s answers to another for critique and review.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A survey was conducted to gather students’ feedback on their experience
of learning in a Smart Classroom, particularly focusing on their collaboration
with peers. Most comments gathered from the qualitative feedback of the
survey were positive.  Students expressed that the Smart Classroom had
enhanced their learning experience by fostering greater engagement and
allowed the facilitating on peer discussion and collaboration.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, lesson observations by a core team of staff were also conducted.
The observations reported that the students were engaged in discussions
on examples presented by the tutor and the solutions provided by their
classmates. It was noted that students demonstrated a higher level of engagement
and collaboration in the smart classroom, compared with traditional regular
classroom settings.       </p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This paper documents the author’s application of data-enabled flipped
learning (DEFL), to enhance quality teaching in a differentiated instruction
context. To cater for his module in the school of Mechanical &amp; Aeronautical
Engineering, he customized the Singapore Polytechnic (SP) generic model
into his DEFL model of quiz (1st step), intervention (2nd step) and survey
(3rd step). Via learning analytics dashboards of SP’s learning management
system, data from online diagnostic quizzes (1st step) enabled the author
to implement differentiated instruction for his engineering students. Customized
in-class interventions (2nd step) were enabled for three differentiated
student categories, namely “OK”, “Not OK” and “At-Risk” students. These
interventions involved pastoral care, supplementary lesson and in-class
feedback provided by the author to students, guided by his evidence-based
reflective practice (EBRP) checklist. The ten core principles of learning
embedded in his EBRP checklist, coupled with its inherent evidence-based
approach, was a structured template to quantify and enhance quality teaching.
Lastly, online surveys (3rd step) via SP’s learning management system provided
regular and timely student feedback, and enabled formative evaluation to
lecturers. Overall analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data collected
from students (n=164) and lecturers (n=7) involved in the 3-semester pilot
run largely supported the use of DEFL in pedagogy. Limitations were discussed
under reflections, reminding lecturers of noteworthy points when performing
DEFL. This paper concludes with a quote from Singapore Minister for Education’s
public speech, demonstrating the fruitful implementation of DEFL in SP.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>The implement of young higher engineer development program in a wide range
of civil engineering fields is an urgent issue against the shortage of
talented engineers. However, it is more difficult for higher education
institutions to more practical engineer development program based on on-site
implementation. Therefore, this study attempted to implement more practical
program for the students in the National Institute of technology, Matsue
college, work on more practical problem-solving and field implementation
through close cooperation between Okumura Engineering Corporation and National
Institute of technology, Matsue college and by taking on the role of technical
and mental mentors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Specifically, we proposed a "park that makes people want to be interested
in the field of civil engineering and construction" by targeting the actual
renovation of a dilapidated park by the students in the National Institute
of technology, Matsue college. First, as a preliminary study, a questionnaire
survey was conducted at a kindergarten to clarify the specific image of
an enjoyable park. Then, a 3D model was constructed from 3D scanner data
of an existing park. Then, a 3D model of the playground equipment in the
park was created and placed in the 3D model of 3D, so that it can be experienced
virtually using the latest VR technology. As a result, a more concrete
proposal was completed through virtual on-site implementation. Furthermore,
the students in National Institute of technology, Matsue college had the
opportunity to explain their proposal to the local residents and held a
VR experience session. In the final questionnaire survey, the proposal
received a very high evaluation. The young engineer development program
in collaboration with industry and academia proved to be highly significant
in that the students were able to gain hands-on experience of ICT technology,
which is an essential technology for civil engineers in the future, through
a concrete study of the construction of social infrastructure.</p>
