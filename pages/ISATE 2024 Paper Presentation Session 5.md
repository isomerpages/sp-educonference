<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The rapid evolution of machine learning applications has put a light on
the need to provide KOSEN students with the appropriate tools to understand
and experience this field of engineering. With this in mind, we have developed
a core design approach for a series of experiments that most KOSEN schools
can easily adopt and that are easy to adapt to the constant changes in
trends in the field of machine learning. This design approach focuses on
experiments being easy to reproduce and maintain along KOSEN institutions
as follows. Reproducibility: Experiments can be implemented with tools
that are widely available to most KOSEN students and academic staff. We
kept hardware costs and requirements as affordable and simple as possible
to ensure that the proposed experiments can be put together without a major
investment of time or money. Sustainability: By using free online computing
platforms, all the resources needed to train, implement and test the often
resource-heavy machine learning models are provided by a powerful online
server at no additional cost, thus reducing the need to buy and maintain
expensive equipment such as graphic cards or robots.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With these two points as the core of our design philosophy, we present
the design of a series of experiments planned over three sessions of 4.5
hours each, focused on providing practical experience in image processing
and image recognition. On each session, students work autonomously through
a python notebook on Google Colaboratory to understand the basics of each
session by running already prepared code that is heavily commented. Then,
students face a series of challenges that put to test what they learned
during the session. As a result from this experiment design, students were
able to learn and use concepts related to image processing to solve problems
in a flexible and independent way. For our study case, it was observed
that, in average, students took over 1.5 hours to go through and understand
the examples and around 3 hours to solve the challenges and developed a
sense of understanding of the topics discussed on each session.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This research study focuses on the integration of Generative Artificial
Intelligence (Gen AI) into the research process of design projects. The
study aims to enhance the learning experience for students in the Product
Technologies and System Design (PDTSD) module. It addresses the challenges
students face in traditional research methods, such as difficulty in sourcing
relevant information and time constraints due to other commitments. The
research employs an action research approach to introduce Gen AI tools,
specifically ChatGPT, in the early phases of project research and design
conceptualization. This intervention is applied to a cohort of year 2 students
in the Experiential Product &amp; Interior Design course (XPID), allowing
for a comparative analysis with a previous cohort that did not use Gen
AI tools. The study hypothesizes that Gen AI tools can facilitate a more
efficient research process, enabling students to obtain preliminary research
information rapidly, though they are still required to perform verification
and reflection to ensure the applicability of this information. Mixed methods
were used in the research, including surveys, interviews, and module feedback
ratings. The findings reveal a nuanced impact of AI tools on design education,
indicating a positive shift in learning experiences and increased acceptance
among students, while also highlighting a critical balance between enhancing
efficiency and nurturing creativity.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Mathematics is typically taught in isolation, with students needing to
comprehend the mathematical concepts and processes before they can solve
problems, often working independently. Students often get “stuck” at certain
processes and would not be able to proceed if their doubts are not clarified.
For weaker students, this experience can be frustrating and challenging
as they struggle to find the correct solution. Consequently, many of them
would lose motivation to study the subject.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Barkley, Major and Cross (2014) noted that collaborative learning encourages
students to work together to tackle difficult learning challenges and to
learn from one another. This study aimed to observe students’ learning
experience in Smart Classrooms and gather insights into how tutors utilise
the Smart Classroom features to enhance collaborative learning. The participants
in this study are Year 1 students enrolled in the module Engineering Mathematics
2 (EM2) at Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In October 2023 semester, all EM2 lessons were taught in Smart Classrooms.
This allowed lecturers to design learning activities that would enable
students to work as a group to discuss and solve mathematics problems.
Students interacted with the touchscreens through annotations and screen
casting one group’s answers to another for critique and review.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A survey was conducted to gather students’ feedback on their experience
of learning in a Smart Classroom, particularly focusing on their collaboration
with peers. Most comments gathered from the qualitative feedback of the
survey were positive.  Students expressed that the Smart Classroom had
enhanced their learning experience by fostering greater engagement and
allowed the facilitating on peer discussion and collaboration.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, lesson observations by a core team of staff were also conducted.
The observations reported that the students were engaged in discussions
on examples presented by the tutor and the solutions provided by their
classmates. It was noted that students demonstrated a higher level of engagement
and collaboration in the smart classroom, compared with traditional regular
classroom settings.       </p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This paper documents the author’s application of data-enabled flipped
learning (DEFL), to enhance quality teaching in a differentiated instruction
context. To cater for his module in the school of Mechanical &amp; Aeronautical
Engineering, he customized the Singapore Polytechnic (SP) generic model
into his DEFL model of quiz (1st step), intervention (2nd step) and survey
(3rd step). Via learning analytics dashboards of SP’s learning management
system, data from online diagnostic quizzes (1st step) enabled the author
to implement differentiated instruction for his engineering students. Customized
in-class interventions (2nd step) were enabled for three differentiated
student categories, namely “OK”, “Not OK” and “At-Risk” students. These
interventions involved pastoral care, supplementary lesson and in-class
feedback provided by the author to students, guided by his evidence-based
reflective practice (EBRP) checklist. The ten core principles of learning
embedded in his EBRP checklist, coupled with its inherent evidence-based
approach, was a structured template to quantify and enhance quality teaching.
Lastly, online surveys (3rd step) via SP’s learning management system provided
regular and timely student feedback, and enabled formative evaluation to
lecturers. Overall analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data collected
from students (n=164) and lecturers (n=7) involved in the 3-semester pilot
run largely supported the use of DEFL in pedagogy. Limitations were discussed
under reflections, reminding lecturers of noteworthy points when performing
DEFL. This paper concludes with a quote from Singapore Minister for Education’s
public speech, demonstrating the fruitful implementation of DEFL in SP.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>The implement of young higher engineer development program in a wide range
of civil engineering fields is an urgent issue against the shortage of
talented engineers. However, it is more difficult for higher education
institutions to more practical engineer development program based on on-site
implementation. Therefore, this study attempted to implement more practical
program for the students in the National Institute of technology, Matsue
college, work on more practical problem-solving and field implementation
through close cooperation between Okumura Engineering Corporation and National
Institute of technology, Matsue college and by taking on the role of technical
and mental mentors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Specifically, we proposed a "park that makes people want to be interested
in the field of civil engineering and construction" by targeting the actual
renovation of a dilapidated park by the students in the National Institute
of technology, Matsue college. First, as a preliminary study, a questionnaire
survey was conducted at a kindergarten to clarify the specific image of
an enjoyable park. Then, a 3D model was constructed from 3D scanner data
of an existing park. Then, a 3D model of the playground equipment in the
park was created and placed in the 3D model of 3D, so that it can be experienced
virtually using the latest VR technology. As a result, a more concrete
proposal was completed through virtual on-site implementation. Furthermore,
the students in National Institute of technology, Matsue college had the
opportunity to explain their proposal to the local residents and held a
VR experience session. In the final questionnaire survey, the proposal
received a very high evaluation. The young engineer development program
in collaboration with industry and academia proved to be highly significant
in that the students were able to gain hands-on experience of ICT technology,
which is an essential technology for civil engineers in the future, through
a concrete study of the construction of social infrastructure.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Weak foundational calculus skills among students, particularly those in
the School of Computing (SOC), pose a significant challenge for the Advanced
Mathematics I (EP0601) module. The lack of calculus exposure prior to EP0601,
coupled with limitations in the O-Level Additional Mathematics (A-Math)
syllabus, has been identified as factors impacting SOC students’ preparedness
for calculus topics in EP0601. This study addresses this issue through
an action research approach, proposing the implementation of Data-Enabled
Flipped Learning (DEFL) as a solution. DEFL, a pedagogical approach combining
e-learning packages and learning strategies for differentiated instruction,
is piloted to bolster students’ calculus proficiency and improve their
performance in EP0601. Notably, our empirical evidence gleaned from the
assessments, mainly End-Semester Test (EST), attests to the efficacy of
DEFL, showing an improvement in SOC students’ performance compared to preceding
cohorts. Concurrently, survey feedback underscores students’ endorsement
of the innovative approach, particularly appreciating the supplementary
quiz questions embedded within the lessons.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Design thinking in education faces challenges like fostering innovation
and managing learners' cognitive skill differences. This study explores
the efficacy of two instructional strategies in a design thinking module:
the Design Thinking with Learning Analytics (DTLA) model and the traditional
Design Thinking (DT) model. The DTLA model integrates the Double Diamond
framework with learning analytics tools to enhance engagement and knowledge
advancement. Using a quasi-experimental design, the study involved 70 second-year
Media, Arts &amp; Design School students, divided into experimental (DTLA)
and control (DT) groups. The study observed engagement in tasks such as
observation, synthesis, ideation, and prototyping, and assessed outcomes
on collective knowledge and individual learning. Initial findings show
significant differences in engagement patterns. DTLA participants exhibited
deeper engagement in observation and synthesis, leading to higher cognitive
engagement levels measured by the modified SOLO taxonomy. Integrating learning
analytics in the DTLA model enhances cognitive engagement and fosters innovative
solutions, highlighting the potential of learning analytics to transform
design thinking education.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In order to realize an inclusive society, this research examines the effectiveness
of education that practices inclusive design through engineering research
and improving the learning environment for students with disabilities at
a comprehensive support school. The student conducting research develops
devices to improve the learning efficiency of elementary school students
with disabilities from the perspective of one of learners. The support
for children with disabilities through the development of assistive devices
was based on a request from a special needs school to the author.</p>
<p>The specific efforts of the learners will proceed through the following
processes: interview survey, actual size survey, product development, production
of a prototype using a 3D printer, verification of the effectiveness of
the prototype, and completion of the final product. The author is responsible
for overall management, supervising the design and ensuring safety, as
well as monitoring the growth of the learner including teaching the skill
of 3D modelling. Finally, we created about seven models and tested them
four times. Furthermore, the verification was conducted to ensure that
the system does not put a burden on the physical and mental health of elementary
school students with disabilities, and to monitor how it is being used
in learning situations. The first development result was that the learning
efficiency of an elementary school student with disabilities could be reduced
by about half the time. Additionally, the use of assistive devices resulted
in improved posture for the target child. Eventually, the child was able
to learn and eat while always using assistive devices.</p>
<p>The learner who engaged in practical development achieved three major
types of growth. First, the learner fully understood the importance of
knowing and improving the environment for students with disabilities. Second,
the learners' modelling skills and 3D printer usage know-how were utilized
in the development and implementation of assistive tools. Third, the learner
created a tool that can be adjusted in size to suit children with disabilities
as they grow up, allowing for sustainable support.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Turku University of Applied Sciences Faculty of Engineering and Business
initiated an organizational change in April 2023 to set up a new school.
The new school’s responsibilities cover the faculty’s common studies and
themes concerning education, pedagogy and pedagogical research. The common
studies include the teaching of mathematics, physics, and languages as
well as multidisciplinary project courses that involve all the students
of the faculty.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By establishing a new unit, there was an aim to strengthen the ownership
of these common studies and joint development as well as the students’
commitment to their studies from the very beginning, thus boosting the
completion of studies. In terms of the staff, the solution’s purpose is
to clarify their job descriptions and thus support their well-being at
work. Overall, the measures also aim at promoting and clarifying first-level
manager work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When leading a change, leaders must understand the difference between
the changes in the organization, such as structures and processes, and
the psychological transition the personnel is experiencing. The transition
is a unique and individual experience. Each change case is different, with
its own individual characteristics. Similarly, the people involved in the
change are different, and each experiences the change from their own starting
points and current life situations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The aim of this paper is to present results of employees' experiences
of the transition are going through from the perspectives of managers.
Answering to questions; how the personnel reacted to the change and what
kind of support managers offered and how did the managers experience leading
the change.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The results and findings of this case study may support pedagogical leaders
in planning and implementing change processes as well as leading people

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Apis UG is a digital semi-annual dissemination magazine that is made at
the Salamanca Highschool, which belongs to the University of Guanajuato,
Mexico. This paper presents a historic review of the two-year growth of
this publication to examine its development and to show the considerations
that are being taken into account to achieve its goal more efficiently:
to motivate students learning and to project the school achievements towards
our city.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aiming to carry out a documentary approach, the history of the magazine
is revised, organizing it in three parts. The first part portrays the first
year issues, featuring the structure of the magazine calling; the second
part includes the results of a feasibility study that was made after the
first year, stressing the magazine format and its distribution; and the
last part depicts the second year issues, emphasizing its interactivity
and information in other media like audio.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the exploration of the history of Apis UG, in the results we highlight
the aspects that are being considered in 2024, while planning (such as
the main role that should be given to students), producing (for instance,
preferring images in which the members of our academic community appear),
and publishing (for example, issuing in a platform that allows hyperlinks)
the next numbers of the magazine. We also point at some of the most relevant
initiatives that are being made to support the considerations that were
found. Those actions are related to the creation of three new social service
projects (Collage and assemblage; Apis UG magazine; and Do-it-yourself)
in which students are developing content associated to the school activities,
designing Do-it-yourself stickers featuring QR codes to distribute the
magazine more resourcefully and making content designed for the general
public. Finally, in the conclusions we reflect on the challenges that have
been overcome and those still to master.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This study examines the effectiveness of the PriME Process Framework in
fostering self-directed learning (SDL) in students. A mixed-method approach
was employed, involving 96 participants and a lesson design intervention
across two modules. The intervention utilized context-specific activities
and a personalized goal-setting strategy within the PriME framework.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quantitative analysis using the SDL Index revealed significant improvements
in specific aspects of SDL. Module 1 showed enhanced "Plan Approach" and
"Collaborative Communication," indicating the effectiveness of the framework
in improving planning skills. Similarly, Module 2 demonstrated improvement
in specific items of "Collaborative Communication," suggesting a positive
impact on collaboration and communication skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Qualitative data from focus groups revealed three key themes: 1) enhanced
monitoring of the learning process, 2) improved planning through the framework's
guidance, and 3) extended learning beyond the modules, with students applying
the acquired skills in various aspects of their lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This research suggests that the PriME Process Framework shows potential
in promoting and developing SDL skills among students, possibly leading
to lifelong learning habits.</p>

education in the era of the metaverse and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Philosophy has changed people's worldviews and the meanings of concepts.
However, this is not the exclusive patent of philosophy. Technology also
has that power. For example, with the development of communication technology,
the meaning of ‘reality’ is shifting from the physical world to the information
space.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The major difference between the information space and the physical world
is the difference in the degree of freedom in each. The basic structure
of the information space is language. The degree of freedom in information
space is much higher than that in the physical world. For example, it is
almost impossible to double the amount of seawater on Earth in the physical
world, but it is possible to imagine it in the linguistic space. Furthermore,
it is also possible to scientifically analyze what kind of effects will
occur as a result.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Indeed, this imagination may just be a fiction. However, such fictions
and imaginations are what create our worldview. And we can only gather
information from the world that is related to our desired world image and
goals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mathematics is a study that explores how freely theorems can be derived
based on a set of axioms and inference rules in language space (information
space). In other words, it is the study of how much freedom can be achieved
in language space according to rules. Furthermore, the degree of freedom
in setting axioms in mathematics is much higher than that in setting hypotheses
in science. As Poincaré said, any axiom setting in mathematics is possible
as long as it is consistent. It may be contrary to experience or intuition.
In other words, there are three kinds of freedom in mathematics: freedom
of setting of hypotheses, freedom of reasonings, and freedom of consequences.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mathematics' free-minded education allows people to broaden their worldviews
and have diverse worldviews. This kind of free imagination gained through
mathematics will no doubt become an important power in creating new value
in the metaverse world, which will become more realistic with the development
of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>This study attempts to examine our Learning-by-Teaching Program staff’s
(LT staff’s) self-regulated learning, exploring perspectives to enhance
our LT program. We introduced our LT program in 2009 as a countermeasure
for these problems: 1) decline in numeracy skills of the students, 2) more
students having trouble tackling assignments, and 3) lower communication
skills of the students. This program intends to promote planning skills,
teaching skills and communication skills of our senior students (LT staff)
and numeracy skills of our first- and second-year students (LT students)
at the same time. The improving LT students’ mathematics test results and
the high rating in survey of both the LT staff and the LT students have
demonstrated the program’s innovativeness. From among 35 staff of 2023
first year student math course, we select two staff, who had the top mathematics
grade from first year to fourth year. We see these two staff’s learning
qualitatively based on the survey results and their yearly reports. The
following are the results: 1) Staff A’s learning met all the ten self-regulated
learning phases, and its survey results were high with gradual improvement.
Staff A’s students’ survey results were high throughout the year. Staff
A, who is good at math and do not usually study math, did not know how
to prepare for math exams but is committed to teaching and learned to give
advice one after another by carefully watching its students. Staff A set
specific steps of studying, monitored its teaching and its students’ work
with self-reflection. 2) Staff B’s learning met nine self-regulated learning
phases but failed to meet one phase: committed to teaching. Staff B’s survey
results were high in the first two quarters, but gradually became lower.
Staff B’s students’ survey results were low throughout the year. Staff
B was aware of its bad habit of talking too fast and ending conversations
with one-sided stories and tried to overcome its difficulty in speaking
by focusing on each student. These results show that both staff’s self-regulated
learning has been generally successful, together with both staff’s measures
to overcome their own weaknesses.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as
ChatGPT, is reshaping assessment methodologies in education. Preliminary
findings from Kim et al. (2024) indicate that a critical engagement with
AI tools significantly benefits students' grasp of complex concepts, sharpens
their cognitive abilities, and promotes responsible technology use within
an academic context.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In April 2024, the School of Engineering at Temasek Polytechnic in Singapore
embarked on a new Engineering Mathematics Assignment designed to harness
the potential of GenAI positively. The objective was to encourage students
to utilize GenAI not merely as a means to expedite answers but as a tool
to enhance their comprehension of underlying concepts. Amid concerns about
academic integrity and the risk of compromising the depth of learning experiences,
an new assessment framework was implemented to encourage students to apply
GenAI in a meaningful way. This framework seeks to promote critical thinking
while employing AI technologies, centered around a revised assessment strategy
that includes video assignments evaluated based on mathematical accuracy,
conceptual understanding, analytical critique for method improvement, and
the quality of presentation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Surveys were conducted to have a better understanding of the profiles
of students in this exercise, and how they use GenAI to aid their understanding
and presentation of the concepts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on AI's role in education
by gaining some insights on the move in GenAI use in a GenAI-neutral assignment,
especially in the context of Engineering Mathematics. This will help us
determine whether integrating AI tools has enriched students’ learning
experience so that we can continuously refine our assessment strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our school started entrepreneurship education in April 2023, funded by
the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology's "Start-up
Environment Development Project for KOSEN". Our school defines entrepreneurship
as "the ability to proactively create one's own life", including leadership,
imagination, management skills, a spirit of challenge, and communication
skills, as abilities required of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The educational plan in our schools consists of the following three phases.</p>
<p></p>
<p>STEP1: As a basic education, "Introduction to Entrepreneurship" will be
offered as a required course for first-year students starting in FY2024.
In this course, students will learn how to think about finding and solving
problems and how to proceed with projects, while also gaining an understanding
of the elements necessary for entrepreneurship, such as the ability to
think outside the box, imagination, and management skills. During the preparation
period, FY2023, a lecture was held in August to interest students in entrepreneurship.
In addition, "Pre-Course on Introduction to Entrepreneurship" was offered
in the second semester.</p>
<p></p>
<p>STEP2: As education leading to practice, students learn how to proceed
with projects and develop management skills. A Project-Based Learning (PBL)
course will be developed in the "Experiments in Composite Creation" for
fourth-year students in all departments. In this course, students work
to solve problems in collaboration with local companies. Furthermore, starting
in FY2024, the equipment procured for the Workshop, as described below,
has been installed in the Workshop or loaned out to various departments
to achieve this purpose.</p>
<p></p>
<p>STEP3: The "Entrepreneurship Education Workshop" was established to enable
students to work independently to solve a variety of problems. This Workshop
consists of the "Realize Studio" for maturing ideas in the information
digital field and the "Trial Factory" for creating products based on one's
own ideas. The Realize Studio is equipped with a full-body 3D scanner,
a photographic 3D measurement system, and a 3D laser scanning system to
reproduce a highly realistic virtual space and work on software and product
development combining AI, AR, and VR. The Trial Factory is equipped with
a 3D printer, a small 3D scanner, a laser cutter, a digital microscope,
and a vacuum freeze-dryer. In this environment, students are challenged
to freely create ideas and products in their free time, in addition to
participating in PBL classes, without boundaries imposed by departments.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The pervasive influence of technology challenges students’ cognitive and
socio-emotional development through digital connectivity issues of maintaining
attention, fostering isolation. This hinders the development of both interpersonal
skills and critical thinking essential for effective communication, social
engagement, and problem-solving – skills increasingly crucial in the evolving
landscape of work. Consequently, students face difficulties addressing
their academic and personal concerns, hindering their development.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dalvi, Sawant, and Sambhaji (2023) highlighted the critical role of educators
in addressing these challenges by focusing on psychological outcomes of
digital education. In response, the proposed Converse Canvas uses guided
dialogue as a catalyst for cognitive and socio-emotional development during
Careperson hour. The implementation of Converse Canvas serves as a case
study of how it can contribute to fostering self-directed learners and
resilient youths.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Careperson session involved students utilising a deck of cards featuring
structured and diverse topics, curated to address issues relevant to students’
academic journey. Students select a resonant card, reflecting upon their
challenges, and are guided through subsequent steps for tailored solutions.
Converse Canvas generates meaningful conversation based on shared challenges
within a peer-driven learning environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The case study revealed that it also serves as a forecasting tool. Students
gained awareness of potential challenges they may encounter, enabling them
to anticipate obstacles in the future. With improved foresight, students
experienced reduced stress levels as they prepared for upcoming challenges.
Findings gathered from this pilot study unveiled a spectrum of challenges,
spanning from adjusting to new pedagogical approaches in the first year
to societal integration in subsequent years. These insights have informed
iterations in the card development process, granting effective resource
allocation to be tailored to the diverse needs of students requiring support.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Conducting Converse Canvas for students is imperative given the increasing
complexities of the digital world. Adopting this tool helps students gain
autonomy over their learning experiences and cultivate a growth mindset.
Converse Canvas has shown to be an efficacious approach to nurture resilience
in students navigating academic transitions and subsequently, the evolving
professional landscape.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Studies have shown that reflective practice can lead to insights that
can guide learners’ decisions and actions in self-directed learning (SDL)
(Dutta et al., 2023). Among the attributes that are relevant to SDL are,
understanding of self and others (Lee &amp; Mori, 2021), evaluating one’s
beliefs and assumptions and making connections between aspects of their
self and their experiences (Travers et al., 2014). The objective of this
mixed-method research study was to find out whether regular self-reflections
within a first-year studio-based project module enabled students to draw
insights, to become more self and socially aware and to engage in self-evaluation.
Students from 21 classes were introduced to the ‘Rolfe Reflective Model’
(Rolfe et al., 2011) which included guiding questions that were customised
to the weekly topics and activities. The initial interviews with 8 students
revealed that they appreciated how the structured reflective process led
to better self-understanding and that the questions were helpful in targeting
areas for growth. Further content analysis was conducted on 63 reflections
from 21 students (one randomly selected student from each class), at 3
intervals across the semester, in Weeks 4, 12 and 16. Repeated measures
ANOVA indicated that the mean ratings (based on a scale 1-5) for insight,
social awareness and making connections did not change significantly over
the course of the semester. Insight ratings were particularly high throughout
the semester with 81% of initial reflections and 71.4% of final reflections
having ratings of 4 and 5. In contrast, social awareness ratings were consistently
low. In fact, there was a complete absence of any indication of social
awareness, in 33.3% of the initial reflections and 42.9% of the final reflections.
Additionally, the ratings for self-understanding decreased significantly
over the semester, F(2, 60) = 4.30, p = .021, despite students’ own perceptions
of their increasing self-understanding. Reflecting about self and others,
which may have important implications for self-directed learning in our
students, require further scrutiny in future studies.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>The purpose of the research is to describe what could drive students’
motivation to participate in international exchange activities and enhance
their global mindset. Since an institutional project began in 2020, our
research has shown how input and output activities have been incorporated
to optimize students’ English communication skills (Ichikawa et al., 2023).
The survey showed that their international-related skills and awareness
were developed (Matsumoto et al., 2023). Several international programs
are involved: International Exchange Video Contest (IEVC), Thailand-Japan
Students Science Fair (or ICT Fair), and TEDxToyotaKOSEN. One of the advantages
of all the programs being connected is that each one can be an incentive
for students to join the other. That can also motivate other students who
have joined them yet to be involved. A growing number of students want
to join the contest from the Thai school, and TJ project from our college.
TEDx has attracted many students since it was launched. As shown in IEVC,
digital transformation (DX) has expanded the possibility of an educational
setting that was limited to classrooms before. However, students must be
rewarded with an opportunity to communicate face-to-face in order to develop
their relationships. Another advantage is that teachers have also developed
their bonds so that they can trust each other, and less explanation is
needed to work on the programs. They have shared their input and achievements
in managing the programs, which encourages their students to join them
and supports them flexibly when students have problems. Each program has
a different outcome in terms of a global mindset. The research will describe
how the features of the program and its outcome are related. Then, we would
like to show that all the programs were interrelated to enhance students’
global mindset holistically.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The cybersecurity industry is inherently dynamic, constantly evolving
to keep pace with ever-changing threats and technologies. Traditional teaching
and learning methods may not adequately prepare our students for the industry's
demands. Therefore, there is a growing need to stay updated on the rapidly
changing landscape of the security industry and shift from conventional
teacher-centred approaches to more flexible learner-centred strategies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This paper presents a practical approach in teaching Server &amp; Cloud
Security (SCS) module that integrates learner-centred methodologies with
industry currency to tackle prevalent challenges. This module is part of
Diploma in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics and is undertaken by students
in the second year of study.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The design of this module introduces four innovative features to keep
teaching and learning up to date. They are (1) Integration industry relevant
content through the adoption of industry certification (2) Develop self-directed
learning practices by encouraging learning via online platforms e.g. LinkedIn
Learning (3) Facilitate opportunities for practice to ensure students have
develop practical skills even on their own through auto-provisioned and
auto-graded cloud lab environment (4) Alignment with national initiatives
for ICT e.g. Artificial Intelligence to ensure the development of relevant
skillsets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>95 students were enrolled in the programme which took place in Academic
Year 2023. Student were asked about their experiences in this module via
feedback and questionnaire about this new framework for designing module
experience. Over 85% of students agreed that the modules enhance SCS learning
by providing a strong framework, while also improving the overall student
learning experience. Additionally, the findings provide valuable insights
such as self-directed learning approach and industry-in-curriculum for
other teaching teams, promoting the adoption of learner-centred methods
and industry relevance in curriculum design.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By advocating for ongoing enhancements in learner-centred approaches,
the module is able to ensure learning experience that is responsive to
industry changes and able to prepare students for success as a work-ready
graduate with the relevant skills sets for life-long learning.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In response to the shift to virtual spaces for both private and work use
due to the outbreak of COVID-19, expectations for the metaverse have increased,
and product development has been dramatically active in recent years. The
realization of a metaverse involves a lot of technologies, including creating
human user interfaces, connecting hardware and networks, constructing,
and managing servers, and representing users in virtual spaces. Schools
typically offer classes on these technologies separately, and often fail
to emphasize the connections between them. However, the absence of these
connections may result in biases in engineers' knowledge, hindering better
user experiences and potentially contributing to the decline of the metaverse
field. We have designed a class to educate the engineer supporting metaverse
technology through both hardware and software. In the class, topics are
(A) Hardware creation on the embedded systems, (B) Hardware control via
networks, (C) Understanding and operating networks by building cloud servers,
and (D) User expression in online spaces using motion capture. In topic
(A), a line-trace car is created using a microcontroller and various sensors.
Students acquire the knowledge necessary for creating a user interface,
such as creating a car body using a laser cutter and 3D printer, creating
electronic circuits with various sensors, and controlling hardware using
a microcontroller. In topic (B), students develop a system to control the
wheeled robot via a web page. This process helps students to understand
a way to connect hardware and software. In topic (C), students learn a
way to construct and manage servers by virtual machines. A key aspect of
this topic is using virtual machines. Students can learn a way to construct
flexible servers by using virtual machines. In topic (D), students learn
how to detect user motion and deploy avatars in virtual space with their
own motion data. Furthermore, students learn how to express avatars in
virtual space by creating models and textures based on the acquired motion
data and creating animated movies. The purpose of this paper is to report
and to discuss the effectiveness of the class.</p>
