<p>Abstract</p>
<p>With the rise of generative AI tools, it is increasingly important to
equip students with prompt engineering skills. However, existing frameworks
are often complex, making them hard to apply effectively. To address this,
we introduce the CRAFT framework (Context, Role, Audience, Format, Tone),
which is designed to simplify prompt engineering with a straightforward
acronym.</p>
<p>The CRAFT framework is taught in the “Artificial Intelligence and its
Impact” (AII) module, part of the mandatory Common Core Curriculum (CCC)
for all Singapore Polytechnic (SP) students. In addition, CRAFT is also
used in other CCC modules, demonstrating its adaptability and potential
to standardize prompt engineering practices across various subjects.</p>
<p>In this paper, we describe how the CRAFT framework was conceived, how
it was integrated in CCC, how students applied CRAFT, and how they utilized
AI responses in their projects. We evaluate the effectiveness of CRAFT
through a mixed-methods approach, including a quantitative survey and a
qualitative analysis of students’ project responses.</p>
<p>CRAFT sets itself apart with its memorable acronym and ability to enhance
AI responses. With this easy-to-remember mnemonic, we aim to establish
the CRAFT framework as a common language for all SP students, equipping
them with essential prompt engineering skills to use AI more effectively
in their studies.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>When students encounter difficulty in comprehending certain concept, they
might need prompt help and support from their tutors. But tutors are not
available round the clock to clarify their doubts. In this project, we
explore the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based chatbot named as
AskCher, for providing personalized learning support to the students when
they need the most. AskCher was developed using Google Dialogflow, a Natural
Language Processing (NLP) module that translates students’ queries during
conversations to structured data and returns appropriate responses. AskCher,
the chatbot aims at supporting students’ learning processes while providing
real-time 24/7 assistance to the students. Students could access the chatbot
from their laptop or handphone by clicking an URL, whereby the dialog window
would pop up. In collaboration with School of Informatics and Information
Technology (IIT) in Temasek Polytechnic, Singapore, AskCher chatbot was
developed by School of Engineering (ENG) and deployed to 1000+ students
from three participating polytechnics in Singapore. Leveraging on a single
chatbot across institutions for the common modules contributes to collaboration
and benchmarking. Effectiveness of the chatbot in supporting students learning
needs is studied by analyzing the dashboard visualizations and from the
student feedback and surveys. This paper shares the findings of this project
on students’ attitude towards the chatbot, and how it helps them in the
mastery of skills towards strengthening their competencies in the engineering
domain, and in acquiring lifelong learning skills. By analyzing the contents
of the student-chatbot interactions, staff can gain further insights to
improve the subsequent versions of the chatbot to be used as another channel
for supporting students through technology.</p>
