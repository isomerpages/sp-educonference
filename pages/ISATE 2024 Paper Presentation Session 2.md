<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) has emerged as a transformative
tool in education, offering novel opportunities to enhance students' self-directed
learning (SDL). This paper examines the integration of Gen AI with exit
polls to bolster SDL through the AskWhatCher application, which encompasses
the AskCher 3-2-1 exit poll and the AskWhat chatbot. The efficacy of the
application was assessed through pre- and post-usage surveys based on the
Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) scales, complemented
by insights from focus group discussions (FGDs).</p>
<p>A functional prototype, leveraging GPT-3.5-Turbo and trained on module-specific
content within a secure ecosystem, effectively mitigates challenges such
as hallucination and privacy concerns. This application enables students
to generate their own questions and utilize exit polls for reflective learning
at the conclusion of lessons.</p>
<p>By integrating quantitative data from the MSLQ surveys with qualitative
insights from FGDs, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of how
AskWhatCher supports SDL, in alignment with Singapore Polytechnic’s (SP)
SDL model. The observed positive trends in key SDL areas suggest that,
with continued use and further refinements, the app has the potential to
significantly enhance students' SDL capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>When students encounter difficulty in comprehending certain concept, they
might need prompt help and support from their tutors. But tutors are not
available round the clock to clarify their doubts. In this project, we
explore the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based chatbot named as
AskCher, for providing personalized learning support to the students when
they need the most. AskCher was developed using Google Dialogflow, a Natural
Language Processing (NLP) module that translates</p>
<p>students’ queries during conversations to structured data and returns
appropriate responses. AskCher, the</p>
<p>chatbot aims at supporting students’ learning processes while providing
real-time 24/7 assistance to the</p>
<p>students. Students could access the chatbot from their laptop or handphone
by clicking an URL, whereby</p>
<p>the dialog window would pop up. In collaboration with School of Informatics
and Information Technology (IIT) in Temasek Polytechnic, Singapore, AskCher
chatbot was developed by School of Engineering (ENG) and deployed to 1000+
students from three participating polytechnics in Singapore. Leveraging
on a single chatbot across institutions for the common modules contributes
to collaboration and benchmarking. Effectiveness of the chatbot in supporting
students learning needs is studied by analyzing the dashboard visualizations
and from the student feedback and surveys. This paper shares the findings
of this project on students’ attitude towards the chatbot, and how it helps
them in the mastery of skills towards strengthening their competencies
in the engineering domain, and in acquiring lifelong learning skills. By
analyzing the contents of the student-chatbot interactions, staff can gain
further insights to improve the subsequent versions of the chatbot to be
used as another channel for</p>
<p>supporting students through technology.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>In recent years, the landscape of education has undergone a transformative
shift, predominantly driven by technological advancements. Traditional
lectures have given way to online learning content, delivered through recorded
or curated videos. While this transition has opened new opportunities for
flexible learning, it has also introduced challenges related to content
accessibility, comprehension and efficient revision. This study explores
the significance of text transcriptions for online lecture videos and the
utility of text summarization in enhancing the learning experience. Text
transcriptions serve as a valuable resource, bridging the gap between auditory
and visual learning and catering to diverse learning preferences. They
are particularly beneficial for students who require additional support
or those who prefer reading over watching videos. Text summarization goes
a step further by condensing the lengthy content of lecture videos into
concise and comprehensible summaries. These summaries not only save time
but also provide a quick and effective means for learners to grasp the
key concepts covered in the videos. They serve as invaluable tools for
revision, enabling users to recap and reinforce their understanding of
the subject matter. One of the aspects of our study is the evaluation of
the reliability and validity of existing text transcription tools, with
a specific focus on speakers with Asian accents. Accurate transcription
is vital for ensuring that the textual representation of spoken content
is faithful to the original. We assess the effectiveness of these tools
in accurately transcribing lectures delivered by speakers with diverse
linguistic backgrounds, thereby addressing potential biases in transcription
accuracy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we evaluate the validity and reliability of text summarization
services or tools available in the market. This assessment aims to provide
insights into the quality of summarization algorithms and their ability
to distil essential information from diverse lecture content. In conclusion,
this study highlights the importance of text transcriptions and summaries
in the context of online learning, with a particular emphasis on accommodating
diverse linguistic backgrounds. Our findings will contribute to the improvement
of online education resources and the development of more inclusive and
effective learning experiences.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This study aims to explore the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms
to predict students at risk of failing Pre-Employment Training (PET) modules.
It also seeks to identify the key factors that correlate strongly with
students’ academic performance.</p>
<p>Students' data from the Academic Year (AY) 2021 Semester 1, which included
academic performance-related data in four graded modules across two diplomas
within the School of Engineering (SEG), in a polytechnic in Singapore was
used in the analysis. Non-academic performance-related factors, such as
students' admission qualifications and demographic data, were also incorporated
into the analysis and prediction model.</p>
<p>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was first carried out to identify highly
correlated variables with the final module mark. It was found the cumulative
Continuous Assessment (CA) mark, Mid-Semester Assessment (MSA) mark, normalised
pre-poly result, family member count, and normalised posted choice number
were all strongly correlated with the final module mark. These variables
were used as predictors in the prediction model.</p>
<p>Three machine learning algorithms were then explored in building the prediction
models: GPBoost, Mixed Effects Random Forests (MERF), and Artificial Neural
Network (ANN). ANN performed significantly worse than GPBoost and MERF
- GPBoost and MERF were comparable in the early prediction points before
the MSA. After MSA, GPBoost performed better in all metrics, with an R-squared
close to 70% and a recall score close to 60%. The GPBoost prediction model
provides educators with a tool that allows at-risk students to be identified
early in the semester such that timely intervention can be administered.
In addition, there is a fairly strong correlation between the first CA
mark (CA1) and the final module mark for many modules. Hence, CA1 marks
can serve as an early alert to educators to indicate that a student requires
more support.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Singapore Polytechnic (SP), students are expected to grow as Self-Directed
Learners as they learn using asynchronous content on Learning Management
System (LMS). There were previous observations and feedback from lecturers
and students that reading or video materials for asynchronous content were
not sufficient for student engagement and learning. Students showed the
lack of understanding from the asynchronous content when coming for the
physical class. Online learning activities such as discussion forums, assignments
or quizzes, are needed to engage students to a deeper thinking level for
better understanding and learning. This study investigates the benefits
of online activities such as discussion forums on self-directed learning
(SDL), the influence of self-directedness components on student behaviour
in online activities, and the indicators of student behaviour in online
activities that correlate with learning outcomes in the School of Computing
(SOC).</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>In recent years, everything used in our general lives has been connected
to the Internet, increasing convenience, and making us more and more efficient.
This growth will become increasingly rapid and integrated into the life
of the city we pass. However, very few of us are operating with awareness
of the security issues that are hidden behind the convenient aspects. As
more things are connected to the Internet and more things are linked to
the Internet in the future, attacks targeting their vulnerabilities will
increase and bring negative aspects to our lives.</p>
<p>Even though a large number of people who engage in security are needed,
there is a large shortage of them worldwide. To overcome such a situation,
this study aims to create educational materials on security using robot
control as an example. Since the robotics market has been expanding significantly
in recent years and is expected to grow even more in the future, we thought
that students and engineers outside the information security field, as
well as junior high and high school students without specialized knowledge,
would be easily interested in this field. We then aim to make them aware
of this current situation and acquire new security personnel.</p>
<p>In this study, the robot control environment was built with “TurtleBot3
Burger”, a robot controllable by ROS (Robot Operating System). We have
successfully launched a man-in-the-middle attack on this environment from
a virtual machine that is assumed to be a third party and captured the
contents of the communication. Although the captured contents should be
encrypted, as shown in this study, a third party can easily steal them.</p>
<p>Taking this sequence of events as an example, this paper describes the
process of creating educational materials that will lead to the acquisition
of new human resources, as well as future issues to be addressed.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Microlearning is perceived as a method of instruction which provides bite-sized
chunks of content that can be learned in short time spans and at any place.
Flipped learning affords active engagement with learning materials before
class to allow subsequent deeper discussions, and application of knowledge.
Microlearning integrated with flipped learning thus provides a rich basis
for personalised learning against the background of typical problem-based
learning or learner-centric classrooms. This study examines how learners
experience microlearning-supported flipped learning in the context of learner-centric
settings and provides valuable insights into how well-designed microlearning
packages aligned to Gagne’s (1985) nine events of instruction can achieve
the goals of flipped learning. Pre-readings were created using online SCORM
and Kahoot microlearning packages for non-technical and technical modules
respectively, which engaged learners prior to face-to-face lessons. In
the design of the microlearning packages learners’ attention was captured
using quotes and recap quizzes to activate prior knowledge, learners were
guided in their exploration of concepts using short three-minute videos,
real-life examples, PowerPoint slides, Padlet and Discussion Forum. Learning
was consolidated using self-check questions and quizzes with real-time
feedback. A total of 32 learners from a polytechnic in Singapore participated
in the study where qualitative data was gathered through six focus group
discussions and analysed using deductive thematic methods. Findings indicate
that the learners experienced all of Gagne’s (1985) nine events of instruction
whilst engaging with the microlearning packages. The main elements of flipped
learning are depicted in the themes comprising preparatory engagement and
guided exploration, which were covered by microlearning packages and followed
by in-class collaboration and applications. The guided exploration features
were most prominently experienced by learners, and this was followed by
their preparatory engagement, thereby evidencing the assertion that creatively
designed pre-reading microlearning packages prepares the learners for the
forthcoming lessons.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of NIT Gifu College
has been conducting Problem-based learning (PBL) classes for students to
develop game AI since 2012. This paper describes the summary of this PBL
class and the contents of the development in the academic year 2023 from
the viewpoints of faculty members and students. This class is for fifth-grade
KOSEN students, and the task is to develop AI for computer games. The games
are mostly different each year, but we select either original games or
existing analog games. Students develop a client program that communicates
with a server program developed by the faculty members. This class begins
in April and the competition are held twice, once in June and once in September. </p>
<p>The subject of the 2023 experiment was the card game En Garde by Reiner
Knizia. Students played the game first and created several static algorithms
based on their experience. After that, they tested these algorithms against
each other and created an AI based on its probability. In this paper, we
summarize the features of the AI created by the students, the results of
playing against each AIs, and the analysis of the AI.</p>
