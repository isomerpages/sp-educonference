<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) has emerged as a transformative
tool in education, offering novel opportunities to enhance students' self-directed
learning (SDL). This paper examines the integration of Gen AI with exit
polls to bolster SDL through the AskWhatCher application, which encompasses
the AskCher 3-2-1 exit poll and the AskWhat chatbot. The efficacy of the
application was assessed through pre- and post-usage surveys based on the
Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) scales, complemented
by insights from focus group discussions (FGDs).</p>
<p>A functional prototype, leveraging GPT-3.5-Turbo and trained on module-specific
content within a secure ecosystem, effectively mitigates challenges such
as hallucination and privacy concerns. This application enables students
to generate their own questions and utilize exit polls for reflective learning
at the conclusion of lessons.</p>
<p>By integrating quantitative data from the MSLQ surveys with qualitative
insights from FGDs, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of how
AskWhatCher supports SDL, in alignment with Singapore Polytechnic’s (SP)
SDL model. The observed positive trends in key SDL areas suggest that,
with continued use and further refinements, the app has the potential to
significantly enhance students' SDL capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>When students encounter difficulty in comprehending certain concept, they
might need prompt help and support from their tutors. But tutors are not
available round the clock to clarify their doubts. In this project, we
explore the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based chatbot named as
AskCher, for providing personalized learning support to the students when
they need the most. AskCher was developed using Google Dialogflow, a Natural
Language Processing (NLP) module that translates</p>
<p>students’ queries during conversations to structured data and returns
appropriate responses. AskCher, the</p>
<p>chatbot aims at supporting students’ learning processes while providing
real-time 24/7 assistance to the</p>
<p>students. Students could access the chatbot from their laptop or handphone
by clicking an URL, whereby</p>
<p>the dialog window would pop up. In collaboration with School of Informatics
and Information Technology (IIT) in Temasek Polytechnic, Singapore, AskCher
chatbot was developed by School of Engineering (ENG) and deployed to 1000+
students from three participating polytechnics in Singapore. Leveraging
on a single chatbot across institutions for the common modules contributes
to collaboration and benchmarking. Effectiveness of the chatbot in supporting
students learning needs is studied by analyzing the dashboard visualizations
and from the student feedback and surveys. This paper shares the findings
of this project on students’ attitude towards the chatbot, and how it helps
them in the mastery of skills towards strengthening their competencies
in the engineering domain, and in acquiring lifelong learning skills. By
analyzing the contents of the student-chatbot interactions, staff can gain
further insights to improve the subsequent versions of the chatbot to be
used as another channel for</p>
<p>supporting students through technology.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>In recent years, the landscape of education has undergone a transformative
shift, predominantly driven by technological advancements. Traditional
lectures have given way to online learning content, delivered through recorded
or curated videos. While this transition has opened new opportunities for
flexible learning, it has also introduced challenges related to content
accessibility, comprehension and efficient revision. This study explores
the significance of text transcriptions for online lecture videos and the
utility of text summarization in enhancing the learning experience. Text
transcriptions serve as a valuable resource, bridging the gap between auditory
and visual learning and catering to diverse learning preferences. They
are particularly beneficial for students who require additional support
or those who prefer reading over watching videos. Text summarization goes
a step further by condensing the lengthy content of lecture videos into
concise and comprehensible summaries. These summaries not only save time
but also provide a quick and effective means for learners to grasp the
key concepts covered in the videos. They serve as invaluable tools for
revision, enabling users to recap and reinforce their understanding of
the subject matter. One of the aspects of our study is the evaluation of
the reliability and validity of existing text transcription tools, with
a specific focus on speakers with Asian accents. Accurate transcription
is vital for ensuring that the textual representation of spoken content
is faithful to the original. We assess the effectiveness of these tools
in accurately transcribing lectures delivered by speakers with diverse
linguistic backgrounds, thereby addressing potential biases in transcription
accuracy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we evaluate the validity and reliability of text summarization
services or tools available in the market. This assessment aims to provide
insights into the quality of summarization algorithms and their ability
to distil essential information from diverse lecture content. In conclusion,
this study highlights the importance of text transcriptions and summaries
in the context of online learning, with a particular emphasis on accommodating
diverse linguistic backgrounds. Our findings will contribute to the improvement
of online education resources and the development of more inclusive and
effective learning experiences.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This study aims to explore the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms
to predict students at risk of failing Pre-Employment Training (PET) modules.
It also seeks to identify the key factors that correlate strongly with
students’ academic performance.</p>
<p>Students' data from the Academic Year (AY) 2021 Semester 1, which included
academic performance-related data in four graded modules across two diplomas
within the School of Engineering (SEG), in a polytechnic in Singapore was
used in the analysis. Non-academic performance-related factors, such as
students' admission qualifications and demographic data, were also incorporated
into the analysis and prediction model.</p>
<p>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was first carried out to identify highly
correlated variables with the final module mark. It was found the cumulative
Continuous Assessment (CA) mark, Mid-Semester Assessment (MSA) mark, normalised
pre-poly result, family member count, and normalised posted choice number
were all strongly correlated with the final module mark. These variables
were used as predictors in the prediction model.</p>
<p>Three machine learning algorithms were then explored in building the prediction
models: GPBoost, Mixed Effects Random Forests (MERF), and Artificial Neural
Network (ANN). ANN performed significantly worse than GPBoost and MERF
- GPBoost and MERF were comparable in the early prediction points before
the MSA. After MSA, GPBoost performed better in all metrics, with an R-squared
close to 70% and a recall score close to 60%. The GPBoost prediction model
provides educators with a tool that allows at-risk students to be identified
early in the semester such that timely intervention can be administered.
In addition, there is a fairly strong correlation between the first CA
mark (CA1) and the final module mark for many modules. Hence, CA1 marks
can serve as an early alert to educators to indicate that a student requires
more support.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Singapore Polytechnic (SP), students are expected to grow as Self-Directed
Learners as they learn using asynchronous content on Learning Management
System (LMS). There were previous observations and feedback from lecturers
and students that reading or video materials for asynchronous content were
not sufficient for student engagement and learning. Students showed the
lack of understanding from the asynchronous content when coming for the
physical class. Online learning activities such as discussion forums, assignments
or quizzes, are needed to engage students to a deeper thinking level for
better understanding and learning. This study investigates the benefits
of online activities such as discussion forums on self-directed learning
(SDL), the influence of self-directedness components on student behaviour
in online activities, and the indicators of student behaviour in online
activities that correlate with learning outcomes in the School of Computing
(SOC).</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>In recent years, everything used in our general lives has been connected
to the Internet, increasing convenience, and making us more and more efficient.
This growth will become increasingly rapid and integrated into the life
of the city we pass. However, very few of us are operating with awareness
of the security issues that are hidden behind the convenient aspects. As
more things are connected to the Internet and more things are linked to
the Internet in the future, attacks targeting their vulnerabilities will
increase and bring negative aspects to our lives.</p>
<p>Even though a large number of people who engage in security are needed,
there is a large shortage of them worldwide. To overcome such a situation,
this study aims to create educational materials on security using robot
control as an example. Since the robotics market has been expanding significantly
in recent years and is expected to grow even more in the future, we thought
that students and engineers outside the information security field, as
well as junior high and high school students without specialized knowledge,
would be easily interested in this field. We then aim to make them aware
of this current situation and acquire new security personnel.</p>
<p>In this study, the robot control environment was built with “TurtleBot3
Burger”, a robot controllable by ROS (Robot Operating System). We have
successfully launched a man-in-the-middle attack on this environment from
a virtual machine that is assumed to be a third party and captured the
contents of the communication. Although the captured contents should be
encrypted, as shown in this study, a third party can easily steal them.</p>
<p>Taking this sequence of events as an example, this paper describes the
process of creating educational materials that will lead to the acquisition
of new human resources, as well as future issues to be addressed.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Microlearning is perceived as a method of instruction which provides bite-sized
chunks of content that can be learned in short time spans and at any place.
Flipped learning affords active engagement with learning materials before
class to allow subsequent deeper discussions, and application of knowledge.
Microlearning integrated with flipped learning thus provides a rich basis
for personalised learning against the background of typical problem-based
learning or learner-centric classrooms. This study examines how learners
experience microlearning-supported flipped learning in the context of learner-centric
settings and provides valuable insights into how well-designed microlearning
packages aligned to Gagne’s (1985) nine events of instruction can achieve
the goals of flipped learning. Pre-readings were created using online SCORM
and Kahoot microlearning packages for non-technical and technical modules
respectively, which engaged learners prior to face-to-face lessons. In
the design of the microlearning packages learners’ attention was captured
using quotes and recap quizzes to activate prior knowledge, learners were
guided in their exploration of concepts using short three-minute videos,
real-life examples, PowerPoint slides, Padlet and Discussion Forum. Learning
was consolidated using self-check questions and quizzes with real-time
feedback. A total of 32 learners from a polytechnic in Singapore participated
in the study where qualitative data was gathered through six focus group
discussions and analysed using deductive thematic methods. Findings indicate
that the learners experienced all of Gagne’s (1985) nine events of instruction
whilst engaging with the microlearning packages. The main elements of flipped
learning are depicted in the themes comprising preparatory engagement and
guided exploration, which were covered by microlearning packages and followed
by in-class collaboration and applications. The guided exploration features
were most prominently experienced by learners, and this was followed by
their preparatory engagement, thereby evidencing the assertion that creatively
designed pre-reading microlearning packages prepares the learners for the
forthcoming lessons.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of NIT Gifu College
has been conducting Problem-based learning (PBL) classes for students to
develop game AI since 2012. This paper describes the summary of this PBL
class and the contents of the development in the academic year 2023 from
the viewpoints of faculty members and students. This class is for fifth-grade
KOSEN students, and the task is to develop AI for computer games. The games
are mostly different each year, but we select either original games or
existing analog games. Students develop a client program that communicates
with a server program developed by the faculty members. This class begins
in April and the competition are held twice, once in June and once in September. </p>
<p>The subject of the 2023 experiment was the card game En Garde by Reiner
Knizia. Students played the game first and created several static algorithms
based on their experience. After that, they tested these algorithms against
each other and created an AI based on its probability. In this paper, we
summarize the features of the AI created by the students, the results of
playing against each AIs, and the analysis of the AI.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In response to “Industry 4.0”, the Government of Hong Kong has launched
“Construction 2.0” since 2018 to reform its construction industry. Innovation
and digitalization are indispensable to driving forward productivity, efficiency,
and enhanced project delivery outcomes. Subsequently, Building Information
Modelling (BIM) is being mandated in all major capital works projects in
the same year. The Construction Industry Council (CIC) BIM Standards also
outline the potential BIM-related systems and integrations in the Construction
Industry such as Geographic Information System (GIS), Digital Work Supervision
System, and Digital Twin.</p>
<p>The Institute of Vocational Education (IVE), in response, has implemented
BIM curriculums in all Higher Diploma (HD) programmes in the construction
programme area and obtained accreditation from CIC. Close monitoring of
final-year students’ academic performance has been carried out from 2018
to 2024. This paper compares batches of Industrial-Based Student Projects
(IBSP) (previously known as final year projects) on the Construction Digitalization
of aforementioned BIM-related systems (a spectrum of digital workflow in
the construction life cycle) against non-digital / traditional topics.</p>
<p>After evaluation, support for software and hardware through the Virtual
Desktop Interface for the massive graphic rendering and data size requirements
in the BIM environment has been provided, with the aim to motivate the
digital learning experience. At the end of this paper, a review is given
on the use of AI avatars for the presentation assessment of IBSP. This
digital reform of presentation enables students with lesser verbal skills
or command of English to deliver projects in a controlled timeframe and
friendly learning environment. A full digitalization of student IBSP is
set up.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Since the mid-1980s, more than 100 international students from 14 countries,
mostly from Asian countries, have studied at National Institute of Technology
(KOSEN), Ibaraki College in Japan (hereinafter referred to as “Ibaraki
KOSEN”). There have been occasional reports on international students on
campus, yet no continuous data collection was found, unlike regular annual
survey for incoming and graduating students including both Japanese and
international students. This paper introduces a feasibility study conducted
by two researchers at Ibaraki KOSEN. Dr. Otsu (hereinafter referred to
as “Otsu”) collected the quantitative data to investigate how international
students’ experience on campus could predict their overall satisfaction.
For the school year 2023-2024, 15 international students out of 23 completed
the survey. Then six of the respondents volunteered for 2-hour individual
interviews with Dr. Hamamoto (hereinafter referred to as “Hamamoto”) .</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics showed that the international students at Ibaraki
KOSEN often engaged in academic activities and participated in cultural
events on campus. They sometimes interacted with people on campus and used
campus facilities. They were satisfied with their academic experience at
school, interpersonal relationships on campus, and their campus services.
They showed overall satisfaction with their campus, and if they could start
over again, they probably would go to Ibaraki KOSEN. To measure international
students’ satisfaction on campus, three major composite variables were
employed; however, since the number of responses was small for this study,
the results of regression analyses were not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Through the interviews, Hamamoto reconstructed the life histories of the
international students, focusing on why they decided to study in Japan
and how they had practiced Japanese language since entering Ibaraki KOSEN.
They appeared to focus on indirect strategies to solve academic problems
caused by their lack of Japanese language proficiency, although there seemed
to be a critical correlation between Japanese language learning and specialized
subject study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, to serve international students better, a continuous data
collection, preferably both quantitative and qualitative, is necessary
to capture their voice. Moreover, KOSEN teachers should collaborate horizontally
for the sake of sharing problems and obstacles our international students
might have encountered on campus.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The tearoom is a building type that expresses the essence of Japanese
Culture's aesthetic ideals: wabi-sabi. However, most tearooms have restricted
access and are closed to the public. This project started from the idea
that to preserve and keep traditional culture alive, and it is necessary
that young people, especially kids, should have access to those spaces.
This paper describes the process of building a portable assemblable tearoom
and its educational effect on the students who participated in the project
and on the people who experienced space. The educational impact of the
project on the students and the people who participated in the events was
measured through surveys, interviews, and observation. The project had
three phases: 1-learning about the tea ceremony, Japanese traditional Architecture,
and planning the tearoom, 2-manufacturing the tearoom, 3-organizing and
holding events using the tearoom. The students were involved in all different
phases of the project. Various groups of students participated in the project.
5th-year architecture students, and the tearoom project was part of their
graduation research. And a group of students of mixed age from all four
departments. Most of the students from the second group did not know much
about traditional Japanese architecture or tea ceremony, so they started
by learning about it. They visited tearooms and participated in a "chashaku"
(bamboo teaspoon) workshop. First, we explain how students learned about
Japanese tea culture and tea architecture and its impact on the students.
Then, we describe the designing and building process of the tearoom. Later,
we will discuss the events organized by the students and analyze the event
participants' survey results. The survey asked if the participants knew
about tearoom architecture, how they were impressed by the interior space
of the tearoom, what they would like to do inside the tearoom, and if the
experience made them more interested in traditional architecture. The results
were very positive, and most people answered they had never entered a tearoom
before and that this experience instigated their interest in traditional
Japanese architecture.</p>

Storification as a pedagogical tool in their course design and delivery.
Using semi-structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis,
the study investigates educators' perceptions, implementation methods,
and the impact on learner engagement. The findings reveal increased learner
engagement, improved understanding of complex topics, and enhanced creativity.
However, challenges such as time constraints, adapting to different learning
styles, and aligning with assessment criteria were encountered. The study
proposes several recommendations, including developing clear frameworks,
balancing creativity and academic rigor, collaborating with IT staff, engaging

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Within the engineering classroom, the conventional pedagogical approach
often involves modelling - where tutors present correctly worked examples,
followed by learners applying the concepts through rigorous problem-solving
exercises. Based on the author’s teaching experience, a prevalent trend
among learners is their strong familiarity with a specific problem-solving
method, but often face challenges when confronted with questions that deviate
from the typical format. The error analysis approach requires learners
to identify, explain and correct conceptual errors using erroneous examples
presented by the tutor. Similar error analysis approaches were used in
the teaching of mathematics and programming; and there were improvements
in learners’ learning effectiveness (McLaren et al., 2015; Beege et al.,
2021). However, limited research involving error analysis approaches has
been conducted for engineering modules. This study aims to add to the pool
of knowledge by investigating learners’ self-regulation and academic performance
through an error analysis approach in a chemical engineering module (“Reactor
Systems”). A total of 42 learners from the Diploma in Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical
Technology participated in this study, where a mixed-method design was
used. This diploma program prepares students for careers within the chemical
engineering industry. An equivalent time series research design was used
since it determines if a pattern is developed over time. The aim of this
research required an observation of the demonstration of self-regulation
from the learners over a period of time. The treatment (error analysis)
was administered three times, with a washout period in between each treatment.
A post-test was conducted after each treatment. In the washout periods,
the treatment was removed, and the conventional approach was employed.
At the end of the study, a survey was conducted using items adopted from
the Motivation Strategies for Learning Questionnaire to measure learners’
self-regulation. Learners' post-test and survey results were used to determine
the impact of the error analysis approach on their self-regulation and
academic performance. It was found that the post-test scores improved significantly
from 28% (post-test 1) to 70% (post-test 3). This is attributed to their
acquaintance with the error analysis approach. The survey results indicated
that learners identified strongly with three of the domains (task value,
control of learning belief and metacognitive self-regulation) found in
the survey instrument. This is supported by learners’ feedback that although
grasping the skill to perform error analysis proves challenging initially,
they persevere in mastering it due to their appreciation for the skill.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Project-based learning (PBL) is effective in developing important skills
in students, such as thinking, Problem-solving, collaboration, and communication
skills, which will be valuable in their future work. PBL also motivates
students to learn. As they tackle real problems, they develop a deeper
understanding of what it means to learn and a self-directed learning attitude.</p>
<p>At KOSEN-KMITL, PBL is a feature of education and is adopted in the third
and fourth years. In the third year, for a given problem, students experience
solving the problem with the thinking skills they have learned before (Problem-base)
and managing a project as a group work (Project-base). In addition, students
create prototypes and evaluate them based on specifications. In the following
fourth year, for real problems from companies or local communities, students
try to solve them while communicating with stakeholders. At KOSEN-KMITL,
the PBLs are linked to internship, followed by graduation research, and
the curriculum allows students to put the skills they have learned into
practice.</p>
<p>In this study, we introduce PBL for third-year students and report their
learning outcomes. Beginning with PBL1 in the first semester of the third
year, subsequent PBLs (PBL2 through PBL4) run in consecutive semesters.
The aim is to undertake Artificial intelligence (AI)-based projects that
meet identified problem requirements. In PBL1, student groups employ the
Agile project management approach to plan and manage several projects,
defining project scopes, exploring frameworks and methodologies, collecting
and preprocessing data, and implementing pilot systems. They propose and
develop automated attendance checking systems with diverse AI technologies.
PBL2 extends PBL1, emphasizing website and software design with hardware
components for deploying the proposed systems. Each group trains Machine
learning and Deep learning models, predicts test data, evaluates accuracy,
and conducts trials until the system is fully operational as a reliable
AI-driven system, reducing manual tracking efforts in workplaces and schools.</p>
<p>By leveraging features such as face recognition, voice authentication,
fingerprint detection, object detection, and IP address pinging, these
systems optimize cost-effectiveness, time efficiency, and accuracy. Their
results vary based on the distinct features of addressing the common goal
in PBL2. In face recognition, for instance, one group achieved approximately
99% accuracy using transfer learning on a pre-trained Deep learning model
(ResNet-18), which was trained on a dataset of 1634 images and tested with
479 images of 11 individuals.</p>
<p>The remaining tasks can be addressed through subsequent PBLs and senior
projects in the final year.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is one of new innovation teaching
and learning approach in Hong Kong vocational education, examined as a
possible catalyst to increase students’ engagement and stimulate creativity
in educational settings. Students' attention is often hard to capture and
imagination is often hindered by traditional teaching methods. The potential
of GenAI is a form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can generate a
new content, including images, text, coding and multimedia, to achieve
the tasks. In this paper, GenAI is examined in several aspects of education,
including content creation and personalized learning, to create an interactive
education experiences.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Content creation by GenAI can be created by educators and students. The
use of GenAI in education can revolutionize the creation of content. Through
AI algorithms, educators can produce diverse and interactive learning materials
for the module of teaching and learning materials. These learning materials,
such as interactive quizzes, case studies of scenario and image creation
etc., can be stimulated students’ curiosity and creativity. While students
learn the specialized modules, educators can teach them to use GenAI tools,
enabling collaborative co-creation for assignments and projects. This fosters
collective problem-solving and knowledge creation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Personalized learning experiences can be achieved through the use of GenAI.
Through AI data analysis and adaptive instruction, educators can tailor
learning paths to each student's unique strengths, weaknesses, and learning
styles or even tailor-made learning materials. As a result of this personalized
approach, students are empowered to direct their own learning, and their
learning outcomes are optimized. Simultaneously, educators can inspire
teaching diversity among themselves and redefine and innovate teaching
pedagogy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By integrating GenAI tools and platforms, educators can create dynamic
and immersive learning environments. Students are encouraged to participate
actively, collaborate thus promoting an engaging and interactive classroom
environment. Although GenAI has many benefits, it also poses ethical considerations
and challenges when integrated into educational settings. The consideration
of issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and responsible AI use
is crucial to ensure an equitable and inclusive learning environment.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This paper presents aspects of the planning and practice of multidisciplinary
collaboration project at Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). In multidisciplinary
projects (MDPs), student learns within a specific field and gains knowledge
across various disciplines. This enables students to utilize their diverse
knowledge when solving problems. It allows students to understand subjects
thoroughly by incorporating knowledge and perspectives from other disciplines.
The challenges we face in today’s complex world cannot be solved by a single
engineering discipline. We need to leverage on different engineering field
of studies. Hence, the collaboration between IHLs and the industry is increasingly
becoming a norm to enhance students learning experience. The multidisciplinary
collaborative projects are increasingly becoming a part of curricula in
IHLs. These projects are based around real-world open problems. This paper
examines facilitating MDPs with industry partners and students’ learning
experience. The project provides a pedagogical way to apply higher order
skills to solve complex problems in the industry. The authors will share
strategies to facilitate MDPs in an effective way. The paper also describes
the promotion of the teamwork competency acquisition through MDPs. The
students involved in this project are from Computer Engineering and Biomedical
Engineering. The student’s diverse expertise and perspectives can enrich
the project outcome. However, managing a multidisciplinary team project
can also pose challenges, such as communication, coordination, and integration.
In this paper, we will explore methods that can help to manage a multidisciplinary
team project effectively and efficiently. The team’s diversity and creativity
help in generating innovative and quality solutions. The authors will also
share pitfalls in the process of achieving innovative solutions. The successful
outcome of such collaboration projects involves creating a communication
and collaboration plan for the multidisciplinary team. This will help in
ensuring the team members work together effectively and efficiently throughout
the project. The authors also highlight the importance of promoting collaboration
between IHLs and the industry. The student survey showed that most students
positively rated the benefits of working on the MDPs.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many education institutions had
to transition to online teaching in a very short space of time. Such transition
happened at the time when many educators did not have the experience nor
the full knowledge on how to design effective online lessons. Many challenges
and issues were encountered by educators and learners in both the synchronous
and asynchronous online lessons. With the experience and insights gained
in designing and conducting online lessons during the COVID restriction,
educators have continued to adopt online asynchronous learning in tandem
with face-to-face lessons in their curriculum despite the easing of COVID
restriction. While many lecturers are aware of the need to design meaningful
asynchronous interactions, many question the impacts of these interactions
on the outcomes of learning. This study aims to examine the impact of three
types of online interactions (learner-content, learner-learner and learner-lecturer)
in an asynchronous online lesson on learners’ perceived learning (PL) and
learning satisfaction (SA). This study adopted a mixed-method approach
by analysing both quantitative and qualitative data. A total of 96 polytechnic
students were recruited for this study. The results showed that learner-content
interaction, learner-learner interaction, learner-lecturer interaction
had positive and significant correlations with perceived learning and learning
satisfaction (r = 0.206 – 0.772, p &lt; 0.01). Linear regression analysis
shows that in combination, the three types of interaction accounted for
51.6 % of the variance of PL and 60.2 % of the variance of SA. Our analysis
also revealed that among the three online interactions, learner-content
interaction was the most significant and strongest predictor of PL and
SA. The qualitative analysis of this study through open-ended responses
in the survey and focus group discussion revealed similar trend where learners
indicated that the well-designed asynchronous lesson materials facilitated
their self-learning process without having to resort to seeking assisstance
from their peers or lecturers. Despite the lack of interaction between
learners and their peers and lecturers for many of the learners in this
study, such lack of interactions did not seem to adversely affect their
perceived learning and satisfaction significantly.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is on the horizon and has garnered
tremendous attention recently. The emergence of generative AI, augmented
reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) has lent credence to the current
notion. Indeed, their applications appear to be multi-dimensional and deeply
integrated among different industries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Despite the technology advancement and its purportedly widespread applications,
a basic and fundamental understanding of the acceptance of AI, the cornerstone
of successful implementation of the technology in different disciplines,
remains scarce.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In light of this, via the gruelling efforts of our 2nd year students in
HD in Dispensing Studies in pursuing their final year project, we have
gained invaluable insights as to the perception and attitude towards generative
artificial intelligence (AI) from dispensers in Hong Kong and our students.
This study aimed to: (1) To conduct a literature review on generative AI
and (2) To perform a perception and attitude study via questionnaire. Notably,
we intended to gain a thorough understanding of the capabilities and potential
contributions of generative AI to our society via the comprehensive literature
review (Objective 1). Our survey specifically probed the perception and
the attitudes of the dispensers and dispensing students in Hong Kong towards
generative AI (Objective 2) and thereby empowering us to reveal the potential
applications of generative AI in the dispensing professions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The result of the current study lays the foundation for the future successful
implementation of generative AI in pharmacy operations for assessing competencies
and to identifying misconceptions towards generative AI. In addition, it
also points to the design rules regarding data privacy, ethics, work flows,
training, and system maintenance etc. related to the implementation of
AI in their workplace. Taken together, this study serves as a pre-integration
research and analysis to be referenced by in the foreseeable AI era. Academically,
the project provided a unique and sheer learning experience for students
while also contributing to the development of innovative solutions that
can benefit the healthcare industry.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the practice of
English language teaching. Due to the limitations on studying abroad, overseas
training, and international exchange events, students have been unable
to engage in face-to-face communication with others to improve their English
speaking and listening skills. In response to these challenges, the National
Institute of Technology Tomakomai College has been conducting extracurricular
English activities in order to meet the interests of enthusiastic English
learners.</p>
<p>For three consecutive years, the English camp has provided students with
numerous opportunities to interact with Assistant Language Teachers (ALTs).
Additionally, an after-school English conversation meeting is held once
a week to help students maintain and enhance their fluency in English.
These projects and activities have gained attention from various community-based
organizations, enriching our school events.</p>
<p>Through collaboration with the local government, community-based English
learning programs have been established, serving a more meaningful purpose
in developing English skills. Participants in English Camps engaged in
various group and teamwork activities to design ideal itineraries for one-
or two-day trips around Tomakomai for potential foreign visitors. Their
well-planned itineraries received high praise from the city tourism department.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in sister city exchange programs, students were asked to
serve as interpreter-guides for guests from New Zealand. Last year, the
America-Japan Society of Hokkaido invited students to a youth forum, where
they engaged in English discussions with international-school students
to foster cross-cultural understanding.</p>
<p>Thanks to these community-based organizations, students have been blessed
with opportunities to learn and use English in authentic contexts. Each
experience serves to boost their motivation to improve their English skills
and participate in studying abroad programs. The establishment of a progressive
English learning attitude has been achieved through the implementation
of our initiative activities and events.</p>
<p>In this research, the processes and effects of our activities and projects
are analysed in detail so that the proposed method can adapt to other classrooms
around the world.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>Inspired by the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent
years that leads to various applications in different sectors, including
education, this study documents the development of an in-house, domain-specific
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) chatbot, called the OBTL Chatbot,
for consolidation of experience of facilitating the professional development
of educators through pedagogical innovation. The chatbot is intended to
serve as a valuable resource for learning about outcome-based teaching
and learning (OBTL), supplementary to the text-based OBTL Guidebook. The
study also aims to assess the technical efficiency of the development process,
as well as the reliability and usability of the chatbot as an information
retrieval tool.</p>
<p>For development simplicity, the chatbot utilises cloud-based Large Language
Models (LLMs) and integrates a single document (the OBTL Guidebook). The
chatbot responds to user enquiries by providing summaries, suggested answers,
and practical examples with reference to the guidebook.</p>
<p>Apart from providing an account of the development process of the chatbot,
a two-phased pilot test was conducted to collect data on the chatbot’s
reliability and usability. Test results show satisfaction in terms of usability;
however, flaws were found in response accuracy and precision by the expert
group.</p>
<p>The System Usability Scale (SUS) was used to evaluate chatbot usability.
The SUS is a well-accepted instrument in usability testing for hardware,
software system, device or service. The overall usability score given by
the pilot test users is 77.4. This score places it between “Good” and “Excellent”
on the SUS adjective scale and corresponds to a grade of “B+”, indicating
a high level of user satisfaction relative to systems in its category.</p>
<p>The study sheds light on the experience of facilitating the professional
development of educators by confronting their knowledge with pedagogical
innovation. The pilot test experience not only benefits the development
of the chatbot but also enriches the understanding of test users regarding
the role of AI in education and its effects on learning and teaching practices.
Future research can extend this study by assessing the reliability of chatbots
that incorporate multiple documents and addressing the challenges associated
with LLMs, such as hallucination and sycophantic behaviour, in order to
establish acceptable accuracy rates for internal information retrieval
systems.</p>
