<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) has emerged as a transformative
tool in education, offering novel opportunities to enhance students' self-directed
learning (SDL). This paper examines the integration of Gen AI with exit
polls to bolster SDL through the AskWhatCher application, which encompasses
the AskCher 3-2-1 exit poll and the AskWhat chatbot. The efficacy of the
application was assessed through pre- and post-usage surveys based on the
Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) scales, complemented
by insights from focus group discussions (FGDs).</p>
<p>A functional prototype, leveraging GPT-3.5-Turbo and trained on module-specific
content within a secure ecosystem, effectively mitigates challenges such
as hallucination and privacy concerns. This application enables students
to generate their own questions and utilize exit polls for reflective learning
at the conclusion of lessons.</p>
<p>By integrating quantitative data from the MSLQ surveys with qualitative
insights from FGDs, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of how
AskWhatCher supports SDL, in alignment with Singapore Polytechnic’s (SP)
SDL model. The observed positive trends in key SDL areas suggest that,
with continued use and further refinements, the app has the potential to
significantly enhance students' SDL capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>When students encounter difficulty in comprehending certain concept, they
might need prompt help and support from their tutors. But tutors are not
available round the clock to clarify their doubts. In this project, we
explore the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based chatbot named as
AskCher, for providing personalized learning support to the students when
they need the most. AskCher was developed using Google Dialogflow, a Natural
Language Processing (NLP) module that translates students’ queries during
conversations to structured data and returns appropriate responses. AskCher,
the chatbot aims at supporting students’ learning processes while providing
real-time 24/7 assistance to the students. Students could access the chatbot
from their laptop or handphone by clicking an URL, whereby the dialog window
would pop up. In collaboration with School of Informatics and Information
Technology (IIT) in Temasek Polytechnic, Singapore, AskCher chatbot was
developed by School of Engineering (ENG) and deployed to 1000+ students
from three participating polytechnics in Singapore. Leveraging on a single
chatbot across institutions for the common modules contributes to collaboration
and benchmarking. Effectiveness of the chatbot in supporting students learning
needs is studied by analyzing the dashboard visualizations and from the
student feedback and surveys. This paper shares the findings of this project
on students’ attitude towards the chatbot, and how it helps them in the
mastery of skills towards strengthening their competencies in the engineering
domain, and in acquiring lifelong learning skills. By analyzing the contents
of the student-chatbot interactions, staff can gain further insights to
improve the subsequent versions of the chatbot to be used as another channel
for supporting students through technology.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In recent years, the landscape of education has undergone a transformative
shift, predominantly driven by technological advancements. Traditional
lectures have given way to online learning content, delivered through recorded
or curated videos. While this transition has opened new opportunities for
flexible learning, it has also introduced challenges related to content
accessibility, comprehension and efficient revision. This study explores
the significance of text transcriptions for online lecture videos and the
utility of text summarization in enhancing the learning experience. Text
transcriptions serve as a valuable resource, bridging the gap between auditory
and visual learning and catering to diverse learning preferences. They
are particularly beneficial for students who require additional support
or those who prefer reading over watching videos. Text summarization goes
a step further by condensing the lengthy content of lecture videos into
concise and comprehensible summaries. These summaries not only save time
but also provide a quick and effective means for learners to grasp the
key concepts covered in the videos. They serve as invaluable tools for
revision, enabling users to recap and reinforce their understanding of
the subject matter. One of the aspects of our study is the evaluation of
the reliability and validity of existing text transcription tools, with
a specific focus on speakers with Asian accents. Accurate transcription
is vital for ensuring that the textual representation of spoken content
is faithful to the original. We assess the effectiveness of these tools
in accurately transcribing lectures delivered by speakers with diverse
linguistic backgrounds, thereby addressing potential biases in transcription
accuracy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, we evaluate the validity and reliability of text summarization
services or tools available in the market. This assessment aims to provide
insights into the quality of summarization algorithms and their ability
to distil essential information from diverse lecture content. In conclusion,
this study highlights the importance of text transcriptions and summaries
in the context of online learning, with a particular emphasis on accommodating
diverse linguistic backgrounds. Our findings will contribute to the improvement
of online education resources and the development of more inclusive and
effective learning experiences.</p>

<summary>RP_01 PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS OF STUDENT ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AT MODULE LEVEL

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This study aims to explore the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms
to predict students at risk of failing Pre-Employment Training (PET) modules.
It also seeks to identify the key factors that correlate strongly with
students’ academic performance.</p>
<p>Students' data from the Academic Year (AY) 2021 Semester 1, which included
academic performance-related data in four graded modules across two diplomas
within the School of Engineering (SEG), in a polytechnic in Singapore was
used in the analysis. Non-academic performance-related factors, such as
students' admission qualifications and demographic data, were also incorporated
into the analysis and prediction model.</p>
<p>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was first carried out to identify highly
correlated variables with the final module mark. It was found the cumulative
Continuous Assessment (CA) mark, Mid-Semester Assessment (MSA) mark, normalised
pre-poly result, family member count, and normalised posted choice number
were all strongly correlated with the final module mark. These variables
were used as predictors in the prediction model.</p>
<p>Three machine learning algorithms were then explored in building the prediction
models: GPBoost, Mixed Effects Random Forests (MERF), and Artificial Neural
Network (ANN). ANN performed significantly worse than GPBoost and MERF
- GPBoost and MERF were comparable in the early prediction points before
the MSA. After MSA, GPBoost performed better in all metrics, with an R-squared
close to 70% and a recall score close to 60%. The GPBoost prediction model
provides educators with a tool that allows at-risk students to be identified
early in the semester such that timely intervention can be administered.
In addition, there is a fairly strong correlation between the first CA
mark (CA1) and the final module mark for many modules. Hence, CA1 marks
can serve as an early alert to educators to indicate that a student requires
more support.</p>
