<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In the era of digitalization, different industry sectors such as business,
healthcare, education, and entertainment are adopting Artificial Intelligence
(AI) powered chatbots. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
has also influenced industries to adapt innovative ways of maintaining
human interaction remotely. This study explores the use of a chatbot for
learning specific programming topics, and as a tool for formative assessment
to engage and motivate learners in Python programming, especially for a
cohort with a wide range of abilities. This study utilizes the mobile chatbot
to help students learn and assess their understanding in a fun and informal
manner, besides developing self-directedness. Three classes comprising
a total of 76 engineering students in their first-year semester two doing
the subject Computer Programming for Problem Solving (CPPS) used the CPPS
chatbot. These students used the chatbot to reinforce their understanding
of specific programming knowledge and attempted two formative quizzes to
check their understanding. 61 students provided their perspectives on the
ease of use, usefulness of the chatbot, the likelihood of using chatbot
for future learning, and likelihood of recommending the adoption of chatbot
through a questionnaire. The CPPS chatbot was developed using the Google
Dialogflow Essentials (ES) Cloud based platform and deployed on the mobile
instant messaging application (MIM), Telegram.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>With the rise of generative AI tools, it is increasingly important to
equip students with prompt engineering skills. However, existing frameworks
are often complex, making them hard to apply effectively. To address this,
we introduce the CRAFT framework (Context, Role, Audience, Format, Tone),
which is designed to simplify prompt engineering with a straightforward
acronym.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CRAFT framework is taught in the “Artificial Intelligence and its
Impact” (AII) module, part of the mandatory Common Core Curriculum (CCC)
for all Singapore Polytechnic (SP) students. In addition, CRAFT is also
used in other CCC modules, demonstrating its adaptability and potential
to standardize prompt engineering practices across various subjects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this paper, we describe how the CRAFT framework was conceived, how
it was integrated in CCC, how students applied CRAFT, and how they utilized
AI responses in their projects. We evaluate the effectiveness of CRAFT
through a mixed-methods approach, including a quantitative survey and a
qualitative analysis of students’ project responses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>CRAFT sets itself apart with its memorable acronym and ability to enhance
AI responses. With this easy-to-remember mnemonic, we aim to establish
the CRAFT framework as a common language for all SP students, equipping
them with essential prompt engineering skills to use AI more effectively
in their studies.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>NP’s journey into AI (Artificial Intelligence) started around 2017 with
the development of the AI Tutor and AI Assessment tools by the School of
Health Sciences. At that time, these were developed by external vendors
based on inputs from NP’s academic staff serving as Subject Matter Experts.
However, ChatGPT 3’s launch in November 2022 created new opportunities
for educators to create new and innovative learning experiences.</p>
<p>This paper aims to document and share NP’s learning and reflections of
its “Gen AI-bling” journey to-date. This is a journey that is still evolving,
with many aspects still in exploration, experimentation and iteration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Initial experiments using Gen AI at NP were small steps taken by individual,
early adopter educators to introduce this as a tool to enhance the “creative”
experience in learning, to brainstorm ideas, to create case studies for
learning and practice, etc. NP's very early dipstick poll of students’
perceptions of Gen AI in July 2023 indicated that while students could
see the value of Gen AI to enhance their learning experience, they were
also concerned about ethical use, plagiarism, and potential over-reliance
and its impact on their own ability to think critically.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The use of Gen AI at NP has since moved away from pockets of early adopter
“innovative experiments” to more institutionally guided, and intentional
efforts. This includes the purposeful adoption of Gen AI tools in curriculum
guided by the PAIR Framework (Acar, 2023) introduced in the Oct 2023 semester
as a clear guide on how to design and facilitate Gen AI-bled T&amp;L (Teaching
&amp; Learning) experiences in modules. From AY (Academic Year) 2024-2025,
all 9 schools at NP are working to step up the embrace of PAIR-grounded
Gen AI experiences in at least one module per level per course.</p>
<p></p>
<p>NP is also experimenting with customised Gen AI assistants to enhance
the teaching &amp; learning (T&amp;L) experience for both staff and students.
For staff, there is an NP Prompt Library as well as Academic AI Assistants
that can be tailored to specific domains or academic frameworks to boost
productivity and academic quality. For students, AI Academic Assistants
are being prototyped to provide domain/module specific coaching, tutoring,
guidance, and personalised feedback 24/7.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While NP has moved its “Gen AI-bling" T&amp;L journey beyond early exploration
and experimentation, there is still a long way to go as Gen AI continues
to evolve very quickly. NP continues to collect more data from staff &amp;
students with regards to their perceptions and impact of Gen AI on the
learning experience as we keep pace with its changes closely and leverage
on the innovations for NP’s T&amp;L.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Assessment, one of the key components of education, allows institutions
to measure and evaluate students’ performance. Conventional assessments
focus on examinations at the end of teaching courses. These types of assessments
also known as summative assessments tend to direct students’ attention
towards achieving specific learning outcomes and high scores. However,
effective assessment practices should provide ongoing information and valuable
feedback to learners to enhance their learning experience. During the challenging
times of COVID-19, different online education platforms have been widely
adopted by institutions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Various digital technologies available on the online platforms empower
teachers to conduct real time feedback, reformulate teaching content and
pedagogy based on students’ engagement levels, progress and results. The
dynamic evaluation allows for the effective implementation of formative
assessment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moodle, one of the examples of the remarkable proliferation of various
online assessment tools, is an open-source Learning Management System (LMS).
It provides a platform for educators to manage their course, facilitate
assessment and evaluate student performance. Teachers can set up the assignment
for students by uploading documents, configuring specifications such as
deadline, with plagiarism checking like Turnitin. Additionally, Moodle
Quiz empowers teachers to create quizzes with different types of questions,
flexible layout and order, and it also supports automated grading. Other
tools, PDF annotator and H5P, have been integrated into Moodle. It allows
teachers to insert questions, comments, scoring and feedback immediately
while H5P enriches the learning experience with gamification interactive
elements including quiz function.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This paper will explore the utilisation of formative assessments, facilitated
by Moodle, in enhancing the learning experience of students enrolled in
the Higher Diploma in Computer and Electronic Engineering. The study was
conducted with three classes of students, employing a variety of assessment
tools and surveys to examine how these practices influence students’ learning
and teachers’ teaching behaviours. The findings of this research provide
valuable insights for educators seeking to enhance student learning experience
through the integration of formative assessments and digital technologies.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The Sendai National College of Technology Natori Campus has a Robotics
course, a Materials Environment course, a Mechanical and Energy course,
and an Architectural Design course, with students enrolled from the first
to fifth year. Each class has about 40 students, and most of the classes
are held in the classrooms of each class. One-quarter of the students continue
to study in the specialized department on the same campus for another two
years after graduation. However, the number of teachers has been reduced
due to cuts in operating subsidies, and the number of classes per teacher
is excessive. To improve this problem, classes for subjects common to each
class are now held jointly as much as possible. Although seven grades are
studying at any given time, there are only two classrooms where joint classes
can be held: a large classroom and an audiovisual room. Therefore, only
two grades can hold joint classes at the same time , and it was urgent
to add a large classroom, but due to budgetary constraints, it is difficult
to renovate or expand the school building. Therefore, we tried removing
the wall between the two classrooms and making them into one classroom,
but we found that the classroom was long and narrow from front to back
and difficult to use. In addition, after the coronavirus pandemic, some
students began to feel anxious or unwell when many people were crammed
into the same room. In light of this, our school introduced a remote teaching
system that virtually connected five classrooms at the Natori campus and
ten classrooms at the Hirose campus to create one large classroom. I used
that system to teach calculus to third-year students for a year. Since
we continued to use a specific classroom as the main classroom throughout
the year, I was worried that there would be a difference in the grades
of students in the main classroom and those in the sub-class. However,
looking at the results of the four regular exams, we found that the classes
that performed well in each exam were different, and that there was no
significant difference in grades depending on whether they took classes
in the main classroom or the sub-classroom.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Data-Enabled Flipped Learning (DEFL) is a strategy where asynchronous
data such as quizzes or surveys (ALeRT) are used to evaluate student learning
needs and lessons are customised to meet the specific needs. The current
study was designed to investigate the effects of DEFL on student engagement
and conceptual understanding. DEFL was deployed in two core Year 1 modules
(CP3048 and CP3035) in the Diploma of Optometry with cohort size of sixty-four
students. Prior to in-class tutorials, students went through asynchronous
lecture materials, completed a post-lecture quiz and rated their confidence
levels in understanding the topics. Based on the quiz scores, students
were assigned to mixed-ability groups. During the in-class tutorial, activities
and questions aimed at further enhancing their learning were conducted
(also referred to as intervention). After the tutorial, students completed
a post-tutorial quiz to evaluate their comprehension and gauge their confidence
in their understanding of the taught concepts. A final survey was then
conducted to gather the students’ perspectives on the influence of DEFL
on their learning. ALeRT response rate ranged from 73% to 98% for the two
modules. In CP3048, comparing pre- &amp; post-intervention, students scoring
≥50 marks increased from 21% to 98% (quiz score mean±SD: 41±14 vs 73±13,
p&lt;0.001); confidence ratings between ‘moderately confident’ to ‘very
confident’ improved from 40% to 83%. In CP3035, students scoring ≥50 marks
were lower post-intervention (quiz score 86±20 vs 73±21, p=0.001) despite
confidence ratings improved from 29% to 48%. In the final survey, students
responded that DEFL was effective for their learning (85%). They appreciated
and enjoyed the group discussion as it provided them with an opportunity
to learn from one another (87%) and helped them to manage their learning
better (87%) by identifying learning gaps. This study has demonstrated
the effects of DEFL in enhancing student engagement and promoting understanding
of conceptual knowledge in year 1 DOPT education.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Arboriculture is a profession of combining a broad spectrum of knowledge
and practical skills. Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) is used to improve
learning experiences with digital technology to facilitate students' professional
development and optimise teaching and learning outcomes through embedding
Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) as well as establishing
new facilities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Department of Health and Life Sciences (HLS) of IVE and Smart City Innovation
Centre and STEAM Education Centre (SCI-STEAM) jointly developed a set of
VR Multiplayer Arboricultural Training. This VR Arboricultural Training
package specifically caters to the pre-employment students enrolled in
arboricultural management and tree-related programmes, providing a learning
platform to strengthen their knowledge of safety procedures relevant to
arboriculture management prior to practical training sessions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the first time, we have added a multiplayer function, which allows
two students to train simultaneously in the same virtual environment over
the internet. 3 scenarios were developed by HLS and SCI-STEAM. HLS was
responsible to design the training content while SCI-STEAM provided VR
hardware and assisted with the training process.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of
VR training in arboriculture. It covers different aspects, including the
introduction, the scope of VR training content, VR hardware set up, design
detail, VR training flow in class, and the feedback on the VR training.
The challenge of the traditional arboricultural training is highlighted
in the introduction. Comparison among the traditional practical training,
traditional VR training and the multiplayer-based VR training in terms
of their impact on learning outcomes are discussed. The scope of VR training
content contains three scenarios in the VR training program. Two of these
scenarios involve interaction between two players. The "hardware setup"
section outlines the necessary requirements for the VR training. The design
detail outlines the software used in the application development and the
application flow. Moreover, the VR training flow in class is presented,
clarifying the training flow and the class duration. To evaluate the effectiveness
and the usability of the VR training, the industrial practitioners, and
trainees to test it and their feedback was positive. They expressed their
high praise after using VR training. Feedback from them is collected for
future TEL development.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Many student experiments are conducted in engineering education, and the
main purpose of these experiments is to gain a concrete understanding of
laws and acquire experimental techniques. Therefore, student experiments
essentially have a “passive'' and “training'' character for students. Now,
in the student experiment, the instructor evaluates the reports submitted
by the students. On the other hand, the student's thought process that
led to the report is not evaluated, and even worse, instructors have no
means of checking the student's thought process. However, for industrial
students who are aspiring engineers, the process is important, and the
true purpose of student experiments can be said to be to develop and evaluate
students' thinking processes. Therefore, we focused on the role of the
experiment notebook not only as a recording tool, but also as a thinking
tool, and engaged in “experiment notebook guidance'' that is not normally
practiced. Furthermore, by fusing the ”analog aspects of experiment notebooks''
with the ”digital aspects of ICT technology, including remote tools,''
we aimed to foster literacy with logical thinking and problem awareness.
Various efforts have been made to give student experiments an ”active character.''
This time, in the electrical and electronic experiments conducted by the
Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, we added to our previous
efforts and conducted two new attempts as described below. 1) Preparation
and review of experimental themes and implementation of web-based confirmation
tests related to them; 2) Utilization of web-based electronic bulletin
boards for students and instructors to exchange opinions and information.
1) The aim was for students to have prior knowledge and problem awareness
regarding experiments. Students read related literature in advance and
then take a test using Microsoft Forms. Tests related to the experiment
will also be conducted after the experiment. Students will help solidify
their concrete understanding and knowledge by outputting the knowledge
gained through experiments. 2) Students will post questions and ideas that
arise during the experiment, as well as the progress of the experiment,
on a web bulletin board on Microsoft Teams in real-time. Instructors and
students can share their posts in real-time, allowing them to follow up
quickly. Additionally, everyone can see the chronological progress of the
experiment and receive feedback on the experiment. By adding approaches
from these new perspectives to student experiments, we could update student
experiments into “a place to practice active learning that cultivates PBL
perspectives.”</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Differentiated instruction (Tomlinson, 2017) has been widely acknowledged
as an effective pedagogical approach at the primary and secondary school
level. However, its application in the context of higher education, particularly
in the creative fields, remains limited. This paper outlines the efforts
of the Media, Arts, and Design (MAD) school in 2023 across ten creative
modules to adapt and implement differentiated instructional strategies
to support our creative students’ learning needs. Drawing from Tomlinson’s
(2017), we experimented with different learning methods including case
studies of varying complexities, interest-based groups, tiered activities,
and peer teaching. Pre-assessment tools such as quizzes, tasks, and polls
were used to understand individual students’ needs. The results from our
year-long experimentation show a positive response from students, with
80% of students (n = 538 across 10 creative modules) expressing agreement
or strong agreement in enjoying the differentiated activities. In addition,
71% of students reported feeling confident in their ability to learn in
these differentiated lessons. Teachers’ reflections at the end of the lesson
showed their observations of increased student engagement, collaboration,
autonomy, and motivation. Finally, module feedback scores showed an improvement
in eight of the 10 modules after implementation. The use cases are compiled
in the annex which other educators in the creative disciplines and higher
education may find useful.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The industrial and social environment is transitioning worldwide into
a period of structural transformation with the rapid progress and popularization
of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IOT) technologies.
Under such circumstances, we are expected to use our abilities to explore
and solve various problems and create new values on our own for diversifying
social issues and needs. To solve such diversifying problems, the impact
of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) on pupils’
learning has been increasingly highlighted recently.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This study aims to shed light on the effectiveness of STEAM education
by taking the case of the SHINAYAKA Engineer Education Program that encompass
STEAM education which the National Institute of Technology (Kosen), Nara
College developed. The purpose of the SHINAYAKA Engineer Education Program
aims to help students nurture sensitivity to create new values and expressiveness
to embody these values, while developing the ability to adapt to diversity
from multiple perspectives through learning in areas that differ from engineering.
Another purpose of this program is to develop new engineering leaders who
can bridge society, life, and technology so that people's lives can evolve
with the experience of new values (creation of concepts, stories, or user
experience related to technologies), which is enabled by combining adaptability
to diversity fostered in this program with practical skills based on theoretical
knowledge learnt in engineering education. Through this program, two types
of data (quantitative and qualitative) have been collected, and these data
were used to analyze the effect of STEAM education in the research.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This paper introduces the statistical methods for measuring educational
effectiveness of STEAM based on the quantitative data and the qualitative

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Team teaching is an instructional approach wherein two or more educators
collaborate to plan, deliver, and evaluate teaching and learning activities.
Research has demonstrated that team teaching can enhance support, provide
rich and varied lessons, and improve learning outcomes. However, it may
initially cause confusion for students accustomed to traditional methods.
While the benefits of team teaching in higher education are well-documented,
its effectiveness in polytechnic education and its impact on external industry
certification examination outcomes remain underexplored. The advantages
and disadvantages of team teaching have been established from educators'
perspectives, but less is known from the students’ viewpoint. This exploratory
study examines the impact of team teaching on polytechnic students’ learning
experiences and external industry certification examination outcomes. It
involves students enrolled in a one-week, face-to-face Python training
preparatory course delivered in a team teaching format by five lecturers
and software engineers. Subsequently, students took the Python Institute’s
Certified Python Entry-Level Programmer (PCEP) certification examination.
The purpose of this research is to analyse the correlation between students’
certification examination results and their Likert scale responses regarding
the effectiveness of the team teaching model, using the validated Learners'
Team Teaching Perceptions Questionnaire (LTTPQ). The LTTPQ measures four
dimensions: (a) rich and varied lessons, (b) increased support, (c) learning
gains, and (d) confusion. Results indicate that students (n = 33) generally
reported high satisfaction with rich and varied lessons, increased support,
and learning gains. Weak correlations limit definitive conclusions about
the impact of team teaching on students' certification examination performance.
Richer, more varied lessons may slightly enhance examination results, but
the impact of increased support remains unclear. Learning gains showed
benefits, while confusion negatively affected examination outcomes. Further
research is needed to establish causal relationships.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>As Singapore Polytechnic (SP) continues its pursuit of fostering self-directedness
in students as a vital graduate attribute, this action research seeks to
address one of the implicit competencies of self-directedness: time management.
Specifically, within the Diploma of Information Technology (DIT) program
at SP, which utilizes open-ended project-based assessment to cultivate
self-directedness, the study examines the effectiveness of integrating
multiple low-stake formative assessments as checkpoints to facilitate student’s
management of their time. Guided by the Temporal Motivation Theory (TMT),
these checkpoints are designed to assist students in managing time effectively
by fostering continuous engagement with their assignments, thereby mitigating
procrastination tendencies. This is particularly crucial in environments
where competing deadlines can distract students. Focused on second-year
DIT students enrolled in the mid-point capstone module, Application Development
(ADES), the research employs a posttest-only design with non-equivalent
groups, comparing cohorts from different academic years. While one cohort
serves as a control group, the other experiences the introduction of multiple
checkpoints in the form of low-stake formative assessments. Quantitative
analysis of coding activities, particularly Git commit data tracked weekly,
is complemented by qualitative insights gathered through focus group discussions
and informal interviews with students. The study aims to assess the efficacy
of the implemented mechanism in encouraging proactive and sustained engagement.
The findings indicate that low-weightage checkpoints were successful in
encouraging early engagement and reducing procrastination. Students showed
increased engagement around checkpoint deadlines, aligning with Temporal
Motivation Theory (TMT) principles. In sum, for educators to address procrastination
in students, such checkpoints can be implemented as a structural support
mechanism to guide students towards better time management habits.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution has brought about wide-ranging disruption
to the workplace with technological advancements outpacing knowledge acquisition
in schools and displacing old jobs while creating new ones. There is a
pressing need to develop graduates who are comfortable with ambiguity,
able to nimbly adapt to change and who possess cognitive flexibility, agility
and resilience to unlearn obsolete knowledge and relearn new skills. Graduates
are also expected to be able to navigate and integrate diverse bodies of
knowledge and collaborate with people with varying modes of thinking as
the world becomes more interconnected and problems increasingly complex.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Project ID: Connecting the Dots (ProID) is Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP)’s
response to the disrupted workplaces that our students will enter. Using
a Project-Based Learning approach, this Year 3 module aims to hone students’
interdisciplinary skills as well as a suite of transferable skills to support
their development as independent, agile lifelong learners ready for a volatile
world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This paper examines the pedagogical innovativeness of ProID along two
distinct strands: (1) its deliberate design and purposeful teaching and
learning strategies to create the necessary conditions for interdisciplinary
learning to take place and (2) the significant challenge of implementing
an interdisciplinary project module for the entire Year 3 NP student cohort,
while ensuring its meaningfulness and alignment with its intent. Data collected
from module surveys carried out over the past three years since the introduction
of the module has been encouraging, with 72.7% of respondents agreeing
or strongly agreeing with the statement that the module “has been useful
in helping me see the importance of collaboration across disciplinary boundaries
to solve complex problems in society. </p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In 2017, the National Institute of Technology (KOSEN) developed a model
core curriculum (MCC) outlining specific attainment goals for education
at KOSEN, focusing on both human competencies and knowledge. Among these
goals, Physical Education (PE) is designated to cultivate independence,
self-management, responsibility, teamwork, leadership, and ethics. However,
no research has yet examined whether these competencies have been effectively
developed in PE classes at KOSEN since the establishment of the MCC in
2017.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Therefore, this study aims to assess the outcomes of PE classes at KOSEN,
with a particular focus on the competencies outlined in the MCC.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A survey based on the MCC achievement objectives was conducted to grades
first students (n=369) and grades 4 or 5 students (n=380) enrolled in PE
at four KOSENs institutions. Respondents' level of achievement in all competencies,
as outlined in the MCC, was rated on a scale of 3 for application, 2 for
understanding, 1 for knowledge and memory, and 0 if no improvement was
observed in PE-related classes. Respondents were also asked to provide
open ended question about what they had specifically learned in PE at KOSEN.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The mean attainment of objectives was compared and discussed between grades
first and grades 4 or 5 students using an independent t-test, with a significance
level set at less than 5%. The significance level was set at less than
5%. Open ended questions were analyzed using Text Mining (User Local, Inc.)
to identify co-occurrence networks of frequently mentioned words.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The results are as follows: 1) The mean self-evaluation response values
for fourth or grades first students were significantly higher than those
for grades first students across all competencies, indicating that PE classes
at KOSEN positively impact the development of students' competencies. 2)
Grades 4 or 5 students demonstrated a greater understanding than grades
first students of the importance of cooperation and in PE classes from
multiple perspectives.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>With our global population reaching 8 billion in 2022, the strain on our
planet's finite resources is tighter than ever before, leading to environmental
degradation, pollution, and climate change. Despite international agreements
like the Paris Agreement and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
the 1.5°C threshold was breached every month in 2023. The urgency for nations,
organisations, and individuals to adopt sustainable practices is increasingly
evident. Singapore recognises the pivotal role of education and advocates
for training in sustainability in higher learning. This action research
paper explores using Socratic Pedagogy in the tertiary classroom when teaching
about sustainability. Complex ethical dilemmas related to sustainability
require deeper examination, and Socratic pedagogy, with its emphasis on
critical thinking through questioning and dialogue, emerges as a promising
approach. The research employed a mixed-methods approach, analysing quantitative
and qualitative data from student feedback on their experience participating
in Socratic discussions. Using Paul's and Elder's (2020) criteria for identifying
behaviours of critical thinkers, the research found that Socratic discussions
foster critical thinking about sustainability issues and concludes that
Socratic pedagogy is a useful tool for educators in higher education to
facilitate meaningful discussions on sustainability in the classroom.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Academic and scientific writing often presents challenges for readers
and writers, particularly those using English as a foreign or second language
(Wittaningsih 2018). This is partly because passive voice is disproportionately
represented in academic and scientific writing. Its prevalence constitutes
a unique grammatical obstacle, as passive constructions can be challenging
to correctly identify, understand, and employ. Misunderstanding passive
voice can lead to significant misinterpretations and result in ambiguous
or needlessly verbose sentences. The nuanced construction and specific
verb patterns required by passive voice also often prove difficult. However,
a straightforward method exists for mastering passive voice: sentence diagramming.
While sentence diagramming has waned in popularity in English education,
it remains a valuable tool for students grappling with the intricacies
of English (Burnette 2020), particularly passive voice structures. A simplified
version of sentence diagramming, based loosely on Chomsky’s X-Bar Theory
and aimed at enhancing the grammatical proficiency of second language users,
was developed. This technique offers a practical solution, facilitating
authors in identifying, comprehending, and producing passive voice through
four key mechanisms: visualizing grammatical relationships within the sentence,
distinguishing between subject and object (a common challenge in passive
constructions), emphasizing correct verb form, and recognizing when to
restate sentences in the active voice (a common issue with Japanese-to-English
machine translation). This simple sentence diagramming technique brings
clarity to passive voice structures, thereby facilitating their recognition,
understanding, and production.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>A sequence of structured activities aimed at facilitating experiential
learning were conducted. Initial exposure to concrete experiences was facilitated
through two practical sessions focused on exploring PV panel tilt angles
and series-connected panel outputs. A quiz was administered to gauge students’
understanding of the two practical sessions. In the ‘Reflective Observation’
stage, students were guided to discuss about their experiences, relate
theory to practice and reflect on the mistakes made in the quiz. Through
the discussion, students made sense of the conceptual principles related
to the practical experiments and in the ‘Abstract Conceptualisation’ stage,
they began developing new ideas to link the theories and the practical
experiments. Subsequently, students proceeded to validate their new ideas
in an enhanced experiment. In this ‘Active Experimentation’ stage, the
enhanced experiment was designed with flexibility, to allow the students
to test different new ideas. After the enhanced experiment, students demonstrated
enhanced critical thinking skills, enabling them to evaluate the effectiveness
and efficiency of different PV setup methodologies. This deeper understanding
empowered students to propose innovative solutions and strategies for optimizing
PV systems' performance, thereby contributing to the advancement of sustainable
energy technologies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students performed well in mid-semester test questions related to connecting
PV panels in series, with 80% getting it correct. Additionally, post-survey
results strongly supported experiential learning's effectiveness in bridging
theoretical concepts and real-world applications. Students acknowledged
the value of experiential learning in understanding the importance of series-connected
PV panels with the same tilt angle to achieve optimal output power.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This study underscores the importance of integrating experiential learning
methodologies to enhance students' comprehension and application of complex
engineering principles such Solar Photovoltaic Panel Optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In the journey towards achieving net-zero carbon emissions in educational
environments, the active involvement of the entire academic community is
crucial. Traditional Building Management Systems (BMS) are effective in
managing a building's operational systems. However, it often misses the
opportunity to engage with key stakeholders particularly, the students
as occupants and Facility Management (FM) teams. This paper proposes a
novel approach to integrating Digital Twins within Ngee Ann Polytechnic's
(NP) curriculum, aiming to significantly elevate student and staff participation
in sustainable building practices. Through a case study involving second-year
students from Hotel and Leisure Facilities Management (HLFM) diploma course,
this initiative seeks to foster sustainable habits and enhance well-being,
contributing to the broader goal of net-zero emissions in educational settings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our approach centres on the development and implementation of a Digital
Twins model. Targeting second-year students enrolled HLFM, this study leverages
Digital Twin not just as a teaching tool but as a platform for creating
an authentic learning experience for students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Digital Twin uses real time data from sensors that creates the digital
counterpart of the physical structure which mirrors the behaviour and characteristics
of the real-world building, allowing for comprehensive monitoring, analysis,
and optimization of various aspects of building management. In the module,
students work with NP’s Estates, Eco and Safety (EES) Department to design
a digital twin as part of their project. Students are to communicate with
the EES Department to ensure that issues with facilities management are
resolved effectively and efficiently based on the data from the digital
twin and their own perception of the environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A qualitative survey post-project, involving 25 students, assessed the
levels of interaction between students and facility managers, providing
insights into the efficacy of the Digital Twin approach. More than 70%
of respondents reported engaging in communication with EES relating to
facilities maintenance, underscoring opportunities for enhancing the Digital
Twin model to promote more consistent and constructive engagement with
stakeholders. This survey also revealed a nuanced landscape of student-facility
manager interactions showing diverse levels of interaction between students
and facility managers and providing insights into student engagement and
behaviour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Going forward, the curriculum will continue to leverage on the affordances
of the Digital Twin approach to provide students with an authentic &amp;
engaging experience that can deepen students’ understanding of their role
as a professional for facilities management and influence the culture towards
more sustainable practices. The integration of Digital Twins within NP
represents a promising avenue towards cultivating sustainable lifestyles,
enhancing building efficiency, and progressing toward net-zero emissions.
This initiative not only arms students with crucial skills and knowledge
but also fosters a culture of participation, empowering them to effect
positive change in their environment for improved well-being and environmental
sustainability.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>National Institute of Technology, Tomakomai College (NIT Tomakomai College)
has concluded an agreement with the Hokkaido Prefectural Police for human
resource foster in the cybersecurity field since March 2018. This academic
year, NIT Tomakomai College decided to develop information security teaching
materials as a graduation research project for students in the Frontier
Course. The Frontier Course is an interdisciplinary course, in which several
members carry out a single theme in their graduation research. In this
paper, we report how the research was conducted and the scenery of special
classes at junior high schools in Tomakomai City. The research consists
of two phases: preliminary study and final study. In the preliminary study,
they choose target people to teach information security. As a result, they
selected junior high school students as a target because the age of our
students is close to the target people and the target may make mistakes
on social media. Therefore, our students created two photos, and the target
students looked for inappropriate points in the photos that led to privacy
disclosure, legal regulation violation, and physical intrusion, when uploading
them onto social media. One is a scenery that comes out of a telephone
pole, mailbox, and bridge. In Japan, they have a clue to identify location
information. Second is a photo in a room which includes some items prohibited
by law, private schedule, and group photos. As a result, junior high school
students felt it was more difficult to find a bridge as a location leakage,
and alcohol and tobacco as inappropriate items. In other words, junior
high school students are unaware of these items. In the final study, our
students created four materials to enlighten threats on social media. First,
they created slides that help policemen be capable of conducting a special
class on checking photos before uploading them to social media. Second,
they created a document of threats on social media for parents. Third,
they created a video clip televised in Sapporo City and Tomakomai City.
Last, they created a revised material and conducted a last special class
at a junior high school in Tomakomai city. Their activities were reported
by newspapers and on television. Through their graduation study, students
contributed to the enlightenment of information security, especially social
media.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami (GEJET) left an indelible
mark in Japan, reshaping its approach to disaster management. Traditional
classroom-centric Disaster Preparedness Education (DPE) faced challenges
in adequately preparing communities for the complexities of modern disasters.
As a response, educational institutions in post-GEJET areas embarked on
a transformative journey, seeking collaborative solutions beyond textbooks
and lectures. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, these institutions
have forged partnerships with robotics and renewable energy companies.
This cross-industry collaboration transcends disciplinary boundaries, creating
a dynamic learning environment that prepares students for real-world challenges.
Robotics companies are rapidly advancing creative robots capable of assisting
in post-disaster search and rescue efforts. Meanwhile, some renewable energy
companies explore innovative solutions for maintaining critical infrastructure
after natural disasters. This cross-industry collaboration accelerates
the development of cutting-edge technologies, supporting both immediate
response and long-term resilience within communities. Two key components
of the recent collaborative approach:</p>
<p>1) Robot Test Field (RTF): This field simulates dynamic scenarios using
robots. The RTF established a dedicated robotics development zone within
the Minamisoma City Reconstruction Industrial Park. Spanning 1,000 meters
east-west and 500 meters north-south, this facility features Unmanned Aircraft
Area, Infrastructure Inspection and Disaster Response Robot Area, Underwater
and Maritime Robot Area, and Development Base Area.</p>
<p>2) Renewable Energy Solutions: Collaborating with renewable energy companies,
educational institutions explore sustainable alternatives for critical
infrastructure. Solar-powered emergency shelters, wind turbines, and microgrids
become essential components of disaster resilience. Students delve into
the intricacies of energy storage, distribution, and grid resilience. They
learn to design systems that function during power outages, minimizing
disruption to essential services. By integrating renewable energy sources,
communities can enhance their resilience and reduce dependence on conventional
power grids. This collaborative program cultivates a problem-solving approach
in students, preparing them to address complex issues. It goes beyond technical
skills, fostering essential qualities like empathy, adaptability, and community
engagement, all crucial for effective responses. The program’s educational
methods inform disaster education and sustainable development practices.
By embracing collaboration across disciplines, we empower future generations
to build techno-social systems that can withstand adversity.</p>
