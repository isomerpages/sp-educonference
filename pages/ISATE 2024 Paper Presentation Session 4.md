<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In the era of digitalization, different industry sectors such as business,
healthcare, education, and entertainment are adopting Artificial Intelligence
(AI) powered chatbots. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
has also influenced industries to adapt innovative ways of maintaining
human interaction remotely. This study explores the use of a chatbot for
learning specific programming topics, and as a tool for formative assessment
to engage and motivate learners in Python programming, especially for a
cohort with a wide range of abilities. This study utilizes the mobile chatbot
to help students learn and assess their understanding in a fun and informal
manner, besides developing self-directedness. Three classes comprising
a total of 76 engineering students in their first-year semester two doing
the subject Computer Programming for Problem Solving (CPPS) used the CPPS
chatbot. These students used the chatbot to reinforce their understanding
of specific programming knowledge and attempted two formative quizzes to
check their understanding. 61 students provided their perspectives on the
ease of use, usefulness of the chatbot, the likelihood of using chatbot
for future learning, and likelihood of recommending the adoption of chatbot
through a questionnaire. The CPPS chatbot was developed using the Google
Dialogflow Essentials (ES) Cloud based platform and deployed on the mobile
instant messaging application (MIM), Telegram.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>With the rise of generative AI tools, it is increasingly important to
equip students with prompt engineering skills. However, existing frameworks
are often complex, making them hard to apply effectively. To address this,
we introduce the CRAFT framework (Context, Role, Audience, Format, Tone),
which is designed to simplify prompt engineering with a straightforward
acronym.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CRAFT framework is taught in the “Artificial Intelligence and its
Impact” (AII) module, part of the mandatory Common Core Curriculum (CCC)
for all Singapore Polytechnic (SP) students. In addition, CRAFT is also
used in other CCC modules, demonstrating its adaptability and potential
to standardize prompt engineering practices across various subjects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this paper, we describe how the CRAFT framework was conceived, how
it was integrated in CCC, how students applied CRAFT, and how they utilized
AI responses in their projects. We evaluate the effectiveness of CRAFT
through a mixed-methods approach, including a quantitative survey and a
qualitative analysis of students’ project responses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>CRAFT sets itself apart with its memorable acronym and ability to enhance
AI responses. With this easy-to-remember mnemonic, we aim to establish
the CRAFT framework as a common language for all SP students, equipping
them with essential prompt engineering skills to use AI more effectively
in their studies.</p>

<summary>NP_10 “GEN AI-BLING" TEACHING &amp; LEARNING @NGEE ANN POLYTECHNIC (NP):
REFLECTIONS AND LEARNING</summary>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>NP’s journey into AI (Artificial Intelligence) started around 2017 with
the development of the AI Tutor and AI Assessment tools by the School of
Health Sciences. At that time, these were developed by external vendors
based on inputs from NP’s academic staff serving as Subject Matter Experts.
However, ChatGPT 3’s launch in November 2022 created new opportunities
for educators to create new and innovative learning experiences.</p>
<p>This paper aims to document and share NP’s learning and reflections of
its “Gen AI-bling” journey to-date. This is a journey that is still evolving,
with many aspects still in exploration, experimentation and iteration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Initial experiments using Gen AI at NP were small steps taken by individual,
early adopter educators to introduce this as a tool to enhance the “creative”
experience in learning, to brainstorm ideas, to create case studies for
learning and practice, etc. NP's very early dipstick poll of students’
perceptions of Gen AI in July 2023 indicated that while students could
see the value of Gen AI to enhance their learning experience, they were
also concerned about ethical use, plagiarism, and potential over-reliance
and its impact on their own ability to think critically.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The use of Gen AI at NP has since moved away from pockets of early adopter
“innovative experiments” to more institutionally guided, and intentional
efforts. This includes the purposeful adoption of Gen AI tools in curriculum
guided by the PAIR Framework (Acar, 2023) introduced in the Oct 2023 semester
as a clear guide on how to design and facilitate Gen AI-bled T&amp;L (Teaching
&amp; Learning) experiences in modules. From AY (Academic Year) 2024-2025,
all 9 schools at NP are working to step up the embrace of PAIR-grounded
Gen AI experiences in at least one module per level per course.</p>
<p></p>
<p>NP is also experimenting with customised Gen AI assistants to enhance
the teaching &amp; learning (T&amp;L) experience for both staff and students.
For staff, there is an NP Prompt Library as well as Academic AI Assistants
that can be tailored to specific domains or academic frameworks to boost
productivity and academic quality. For students, AI Academic Assistants
are being prototyped to provide domain/module specific coaching, tutoring,
guidance, and personalised feedback 24/7.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While NP has moved its “Gen AI-bling" T&amp;L journey beyond early exploration
and experimentation, there is still a long way to go as Gen AI continues
to evolve very quickly. NP continues to collect more data from staff &amp;
students with regards to their perceptions and impact of Gen AI on the
learning experience as we keep pace with its changes closely and leverage
on the innovations for NP’s T&amp;L.</p>
