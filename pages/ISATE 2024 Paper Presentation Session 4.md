<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In the era of digitalization, different industry sectors such as business,
healthcare, education, and entertainment are adopting Artificial Intelligence
(AI) powered chatbots. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
has also influenced industries to adapt innovative ways of maintaining
human interaction remotely. This study explores the use of a chatbot for
learning specific programming topics, and as a tool for formative assessment
to engage and motivate learners in Python programming, especially for a
cohort with a wide range of abilities. This study utilizes the mobile chatbot
to help students learn and assess their understanding in a fun and informal
manner, besides developing self-directedness. Three classes comprising
a total of 76 engineering students in their first-year semester two doing
the subject Computer Programming for Problem Solving (CPPS) used the CPPS
chatbot. These students used the chatbot to reinforce their understanding
of specific programming knowledge and attempted two formative quizzes to
check their understanding. 61 students provided their perspectives on the
ease of use, usefulness of the chatbot, the likelihood of using chatbot
for future learning, and likelihood of recommending the adoption of chatbot
through a questionnaire. The CPPS chatbot was developed using the Google
Dialogflow Essentials (ES) Cloud based platform and deployed on the mobile
instant messaging application (MIM), Telegram.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>With the rise of generative AI tools, it is increasingly important to
equip students with prompt engineering skills. However, existing frameworks
are often complex, making them hard to apply effectively. To address this,
we introduce the CRAFT framework (Context, Role, Audience, Format, Tone),
which is designed to simplify prompt engineering with a straightforward
acronym.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CRAFT framework is taught in the “Artificial Intelligence and its
Impact” (AII) module, part of the mandatory Common Core Curriculum (CCC)
for all Singapore Polytechnic (SP) students. In addition, CRAFT is also
used in other CCC modules, demonstrating its adaptability and potential
to standardize prompt engineering practices across various subjects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this paper, we describe how the CRAFT framework was conceived, how
it was integrated in CCC, how students applied CRAFT, and how they utilized
AI responses in their projects. We evaluate the effectiveness of CRAFT
through a mixed-methods approach, including a quantitative survey and a
qualitative analysis of students’ project responses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>CRAFT sets itself apart with its memorable acronym and ability to enhance
AI responses. With this easy-to-remember mnemonic, we aim to establish
the CRAFT framework as a common language for all SP students, equipping
them with essential prompt engineering skills to use AI more effectively
in their studies.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>NP’s journey into AI (Artificial Intelligence) started around 2017 with
the development of the AI Tutor and AI Assessment tools by the School of
Health Sciences. At that time, these were developed by external vendors
based on inputs from NP’s academic staff serving as Subject Matter Experts.
However, ChatGPT 3’s launch in November 2022 created new opportunities
for educators to create new and innovative learning experiences.</p>
<p>This paper aims to document and share NP’s learning and reflections of
its “Gen AI-bling” journey to-date. This is a journey that is still evolving,
with many aspects still in exploration, experimentation and iteration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Initial experiments using Gen AI at NP were small steps taken by individual,
early adopter educators to introduce this as a tool to enhance the “creative”
experience in learning, to brainstorm ideas, to create case studies for
learning and practice, etc. NP's very early dipstick poll of students’
perceptions of Gen AI in July 2023 indicated that while students could
see the value of Gen AI to enhance their learning experience, they were
also concerned about ethical use, plagiarism, and potential over-reliance
and its impact on their own ability to think critically.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The use of Gen AI at NP has since moved away from pockets of early adopter
“innovative experiments” to more institutionally guided, and intentional
efforts. This includes the purposeful adoption of Gen AI tools in curriculum
guided by the PAIR Framework (Acar, 2023) introduced in the Oct 2023 semester
as a clear guide on how to design and facilitate Gen AI-bled T&amp;L (Teaching
&amp; Learning) experiences in modules. From AY (Academic Year) 2024-2025,
all 9 schools at NP are working to step up the embrace of PAIR-grounded
Gen AI experiences in at least one module per level per course.</p>
<p></p>
<p>NP is also experimenting with customised Gen AI assistants to enhance
the teaching &amp; learning (T&amp;L) experience for both staff and students.
For staff, there is an NP Prompt Library as well as Academic AI Assistants
that can be tailored to specific domains or academic frameworks to boost
productivity and academic quality. For students, AI Academic Assistants
are being prototyped to provide domain/module specific coaching, tutoring,
guidance, and personalised feedback 24/7.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While NP has moved its “Gen AI-bling" T&amp;L journey beyond early exploration
and experimentation, there is still a long way to go as Gen AI continues
to evolve very quickly. NP continues to collect more data from staff &amp;
students with regards to their perceptions and impact of Gen AI on the
learning experience as we keep pace with its changes closely and leverage
on the innovations for NP’s T&amp;L.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Assessment, one of the key components of education, allows institutions
to measure and evaluate students’ performance. Conventional assessments
focus on examinations at the end of teaching courses. These types of assessments
also known as summative assessments tend to direct students’ attention
towards achieving specific learning outcomes and high scores. However,
effective assessment practices should provide ongoing information and valuable
feedback to learners to enhance their learning experience. During the challenging
times of COVID-19, different online education platforms have been widely
adopted by institutions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Various digital technologies available on the online platforms empower
teachers to conduct real time feedback, reformulate teaching content and
pedagogy based on students’ engagement levels, progress and results. The
dynamic evaluation allows for the effective implementation of formative
assessment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moodle, one of the examples of the remarkable proliferation of various
online assessment tools, is an open-source Learning Management System (LMS).
It provides a platform for educators to manage their course, facilitate
assessment and evaluate student performance. Teachers can set up the assignment
for students by uploading documents, configuring specifications such as
deadline, with plagiarism checking like Turnitin. Additionally, Moodle
Quiz empowers teachers to create quizzes with different types of questions,
flexible layout and order, and it also supports automated grading. Other
tools, PDF annotator and H5P, have been integrated into Moodle. It allows
teachers to insert questions, comments, scoring and feedback immediately
while H5P enriches the learning experience with gamification interactive
elements including quiz function.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This paper will explore the utilisation of formative assessments, facilitated
by Moodle, in enhancing the learning experience of students enrolled in
the Higher Diploma in Computer and Electronic Engineering. The study was
conducted with three classes of students, employing a variety of assessment
tools and surveys to examine how these practices influence students’ learning
and teachers’ teaching behaviours. The findings of this research provide
valuable insights for educators seeking to enhance student learning experience
through the integration of formative assessments and digital technologies.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The Sendai National College of Technology Natori Campus has a Robotics
course, a Materials Environment course, a Mechanical and Energy course,
and an Architectural Design course, with students enrolled from the first
to fifth year. Each class has about 40 students, and most of the classes
are held in the classrooms of each class. One-quarter of the students continue
to study in the specialized department on the same campus for another two
years after graduation. However, the number of teachers has been reduced
due to cuts in operating subsidies, and the number of classes per teacher
is excessive. To improve this problem, classes for subjects common to each
class are now held jointly as much as possible. Although seven grades are
studying at any given time, there are only two classrooms where joint classes
can be held: a large classroom and an audiovisual room. Therefore, only
two grades can hold joint classes at the same time , and it was urgent
to add a large classroom, but due to budgetary constraints, it is difficult
to renovate or expand the school building. Therefore, we tried removing
the wall between the two classrooms and making them into one classroom,
but we found that the classroom was long and narrow from front to back
and difficult to use. In addition, after the coronavirus pandemic, some
students began to feel anxious or unwell when many people were crammed
into the same room. In light of this, our school introduced a remote teaching
system that virtually connected five classrooms at the Natori campus and
ten classrooms at the Hirose campus to create one large classroom. I used
that system to teach calculus to third-year students for a year. Since
we continued to use a specific classroom as the main classroom throughout
the year, I was worried that there would be a difference in the grades
of students in the main classroom and those in the sub-class. However,
looking at the results of the four regular exams, we found that the classes
that performed well in each exam were different, and that there was no
significant difference in grades depending on whether they took classes
in the main classroom or the sub-classroom.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Data-Enabled Flipped Learning (DEFL) is a strategy where asynchronous
data such as quizzes or surveys (ALeRT) are used to evaluate student learning
needs and lessons are customised to meet the specific needs. The current
study was designed to investigate the effects of DEFL on student engagement
and conceptual understanding. DEFL was deployed in two core Year 1 modules
(CP3048 and CP3035) in the Diploma of Optometry with cohort size of sixty-four
students. Prior to in-class tutorials, students went through asynchronous
lecture materials, completed a post-lecture quiz and rated their confidence
levels in understanding the topics. Based on the quiz scores, students
were assigned to mixed-ability groups. During the in-class tutorial, activities
and questions aimed at further enhancing their learning were conducted
(also referred to as intervention). After the tutorial, students completed
a post-tutorial quiz to evaluate their comprehension and gauge their confidence
in their understanding of the taught concepts. A final survey was then
conducted to gather the students’ perspectives on the influence of DEFL
on their learning. ALeRT response rate ranged from 73% to 98% for the two
modules. In CP3048, comparing pre- &amp; post-intervention, students scoring
≥50 marks increased from 21% to 98% (quiz score mean±SD: 41±14 vs 73±13,
p&lt;0.001); confidence ratings between ‘moderately confident’ to ‘very
confident’ improved from 40% to 83%. In CP3035, students scoring ≥50 marks
were lower post-intervention (quiz score 86±20 vs 73±21, p=0.001) despite
confidence ratings improved from 29% to 48%. In the final survey, students
responded that DEFL was effective for their learning (85%). They appreciated
and enjoyed the group discussion as it provided them with an opportunity
to learn from one another (87%) and helped them to manage their learning
better (87%) by identifying learning gaps. This study has demonstrated
the effects of DEFL in enhancing student engagement and promoting understanding
of conceptual knowledge in year 1 DOPT education.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Arboriculture is a profession of combining a broad spectrum of knowledge
and practical skills. Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) is used to improve
learning experiences with digital technology to facilitate students' professional
development and optimise teaching and learning outcomes through embedding
Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) as well as establishing
new facilities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Department of Health and Life Sciences (HLS) of IVE and Smart City Innovation
Centre and STEAM Education Centre (SCI-STEAM) jointly developed a set of
VR Multiplayer Arboricultural Training. This VR Arboricultural Training
package specifically caters to the pre-employment students enrolled in
arboricultural management and tree-related programmes, providing a learning
platform to strengthen their knowledge of safety procedures relevant to
arboriculture management prior to practical training sessions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the first time, we have added a multiplayer function, which allows
two students to train simultaneously in the same virtual environment over
the internet. 3 scenarios were developed by HLS and SCI-STEAM. HLS was
responsible to design the training content while SCI-STEAM provided VR
hardware and assisted with the training process.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of
VR training in arboriculture. It covers different aspects, including the
introduction, the scope of VR training content, VR hardware set up, design
detail, VR training flow in class, and the feedback on the VR training.
The challenge of the traditional arboricultural training is highlighted
in the introduction. Comparison among the traditional practical training,
traditional VR training and the multiplayer-based VR training in terms
of their impact on learning outcomes are discussed. The scope of VR training
content contains three scenarios in the VR training program. Two of these
scenarios involve interaction between two players. The "hardware setup"
section outlines the necessary requirements for the VR training. The design
detail outlines the software used in the application development and the
application flow. Moreover, the VR training flow in class is presented,
clarifying the training flow and the class duration. To evaluate the effectiveness
and the usability of the VR training, the industrial practitioners, and
trainees to test it and their feedback was positive. They expressed their
high praise after using VR training. Feedback from them is collected for
future TEL development.</p>
