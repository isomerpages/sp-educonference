<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The recent advancement in AI, in particular Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GAI), presents both challenges and opportunities for the educational sector.
This study explores the integration of GAI within our curriculum, aiming
to enhance AI literacy among students and assess the pedagogical effectiveness
of GAI as a learning assistant. Through a comprehensive literature review,
we identify a notable gap in the systematic incorporation of GAI tools
in teaching and learning processes. Addressing this gap, our research proposes
to incorporate the IDEE model and Bloom’s Taxonomy into the development
of a practical framework for integrating GAI into educational curricula.
The intent of this fusion is to offer educators a systematic framework
by using Bloom’s Taxonomy’s structured approach of cognitive objectives
to advocate the positive and meaningful embracement of GAI tools in educational
settings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This study presents a case study of integration of GAI into one module
of the Common Core Curriculum (CCC) suite: "Problem-Solving with Creative
and Computational Thinking" (PSCCT). We evaluate the impact of GAI integration
into the curriculum using a mixed-methods approach. The adaptation of the
Meta AI Literacy Scale (MAILS) facilitates a quantitative assessment of
students' AI literacy level. Qualitative data gathered from in-class activity
questions undergo thematic analysis to explore students' experiences and
interactions with GAI in learning activities targeted at different stages
of Bloom’s Taxonomy. This comprehensive approach combines the findings
to address two critical research questions: how the integration of GAI
into the curriculum influences the development of AI literacy among students,
and the effectiveness of integrating GAI into the curriculum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This study aims to contribute significantly to the discourse on AI in
education by offering a practical framework for GAI integration, alongside
empirical evidence of its educational benefits and insights into its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The objective of this pilot study is to investigate the effectiveness
of using digital humans powered by generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)
in service quality training. There were 69 full-time learners taking the
Service Quality Management subject in the Diploma in Aviation Management
who participated in this study. It was conducted from January to February
2024. A pre and post survey were conducted using the RATER framework, which
measures reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy and responsiveness
of the students in a given scenario. The pre and post survey were administered
before and after the intervention (role-play with digital humans powered
by GenAI) was introduced. This is used to investigate the extent of a learner’s
improved knowledge, skills and attitudes.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This paper presents the development and implementation of a Coordinating
Module Leader (CML) Dashboard within the School of Interdisciplinary Studies
(IS) in Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP), aimed at strengthening academic monitoring
and intervention strategies especially for very large modules with approximately
2000 students and 30 tutors each semester. Initiated during the April 2020
semester, the dashboard emerged as a practical response to the evolving
needs of IS, aligning with its commitment to fostering student success
through evidence-informed practices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The paper showcases IS's proactive approach in recognizing and addressing
emerging educational challenges enabled by data through the development
of the CML Dashboard. The dashboard serves as a versatile tool, offering
insights into student attendance and assessment grades across modules within
the IS CORE Curriculum. Its primary objective is to facilitate early identification
of at-risk students, enabling timely intervention and support mechanisms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The implementation of the dashboard has also proven productive in enhancing
academic oversight and intervention strategies. By providing CMLs with
data on student performance metrics, educators can make informed decisions
to address academic challenges more effectively. This approach ensures
targeted interventions tailored to the specific needs of students, thereby
maximising the impact of support initiatives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, the dashboard enables CMLs to monitor grading consistency
among tutors, ensuring fairness and transparency in assessment practices.
Through comparative analysis, CMLs can identify anomalies or discrepancies,
thereby upholding academic standards and integrity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This paper discusses the iterative development process of the dashboard,
from initiation to implementation, outlining the challenges encountered
and lessons learned. It aims to provide practical insights for institutions
seeking to enhance academic oversight through technology integration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The implementation of the CML Dashboard represents a significant step
towards enhancing academic monitoring and intervention in higher education.
By leveraging technology to provide evidence-informed insights, IS demonstrates
its commitment to continuous improvement and student success, fostering
a culture of excellence and accountability within the academic community.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) Professional Competency Model (PCM) revolutionises
the educational landscape by emphasising productivity, adaptability, and
responsiveness at the intersection of artificial intelligence and sustainability.
This model transforms education by strategically reusing learning content
and activities at task and competency unit levels, encapsulated in Reusable
Learning Objects (RLOs). These RLOs developed collaboratively across technical
domains and life skills, enable customised learning experiences across
disciplines, helping NYP align courses with industry demands and respond
promptly to job market needs. By strategically reusing RLOs, NYP saves
workforce and curriculum development resources, enhancing institutional
productivity and adaptability. This paper explores NYP's strategies for
effectively reusing curriculum, learning content, and activities, highlighting
the importance of cross-school collaboration in RLO development. The results
show that when RLOs are seamlessly integrated into the curriculum, they
significantly enhance instructional effectiveness, providing reassurance
about the quality of education. The results from a staff feedback survey
are presented in the paper, providing insights into the perceived quality
and usefulness of RLOs and ease of integration into lessons. Despite acknowledging
implementation challenges, the survey offers valuable lessons and areas
for improvement. This feedback loop ensures the continuous refinement and
optimisation of the NYP PCM to meet evolving educational needs, underscoring
its relevance in the current educational landscape. This paper contributes
to the ongoing discourse on teaching and learning paradigms in the age
of AI and sustainability, advocating for the strategic adoption of RLOs
as a catalyst for educational innovation and institutional resilience.
The transformative potential of this approach addresses the multi-faceted
challenges facing education, reinforcing the importance of adaptability
and resource efficiency in modern educational frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>In recent years, the proliferation of computers has underscored the critical
role of technology, particularly in embedded devices where microcomputers
are pivotal. Developing with microcomputers requires skills in hardware
integration and real-time performance, posing significant learning challenges.
This study details a six-month course using the "RA6M5" microcomputer,
divided into three phases. In the first phase, students acquire comprehensive
knowledge of embedded systems and electronic circuits. The second phase
involves lectures and practical exercises on systems thinking, microcomputer
architecture, and real-time operating systems (RTOS). In the third phase,
students engage in project-based learning, designing and developing prototype
embedded systems. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction and
improved understanding, although they noted areas for improvement such
as time constraints and clarity of explanations. This study demonstrates
the effectiveness of project-based learning in embedded device education.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Language teachers often discourage students’ use of translation software.
However, machine translation is a tool that can be effective when used
correctly and with understanding of its limitations. In first- and second-year
English communication classes, about 600 students learned about machine
translation and how to use it. Before talking about acceptable uses of
machine translation, it is important to consider its accuracy. In order
to consider the accuracy of machine translation, students worked in groups
on an activity using Google Translate, DeepL, and Bing to translate English
and Japanese proverbs from one language into the other. Proverbs are a
great way to measure accuracy because the words in the proverbs used to
express the same meaning are very different from one language to the next.
Before the class, students had used Quizlet word sets to study the proverbs,
so they would know the equivalent proverbs before doing the activity. This
knowledge was important so they could consider the accuracy of the translations.
At the beginning of class before the activity, students completed a short
survey about how they use machine translation and how accurate they think
it is. Before the collaborative portion of the activity, we then talked
about the different types of translations they were likely to encounter.
During the activity, students worked in groups and completed a spreadsheet
with the translations produced by the machine translation software. They
were told to notice the translations and how correct they think the translations
are while completing the table. Once all of the proverbs were translated,
there was a discussion about what makes a correct and good translation.
After the activity, students completed a second survey about what they
learned about machine translation and how their perceptions of its accuracy
had changed. This paper will look at the current accuracy of and recent
evolution of machine translation, how the proverb translation activity
was executed, and how it impacted students’ perceptions of machine translation.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The Diploma in Chemical Engineering (DCHE) implemented a suite of 4 skills-based
module in its spiral curriculum to progressively develop in students a
safety mindset alongside the technical competencies required by process
technicians in the chemical processing industries as specified in the Singapore
Skills Framework. The work reported in this paper focusses on the training
of students to prepare equipment for maintenance (mechanical work) in a
module Process Operation Skills 1 (POS1). Preparation of equipment to render
it safe for maintenance requires students to apply Workplace Safety and
Health (WSH) through identification of hazards and the control measures
to take, and application of the Safe System of Work (SSoW) framework and
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) according to the process where the equipment
is used. Due to the students' lack of real-world working experience and
the absence of prior experience in mechnical work, learning of WSH and
SSoW in this context was done by referencing prior knowledge of WSH learnt
previously then scaffolded gradually across several learning activities
in POS1. Research has shown that immersive digital technology benefits
student learning through its degree of realism that allows easy transfer
of learnt skills and knowledge to real life and its student-centricness
that allows self-paced learning, and repeated practice for tasks. Therefore,
an Immersive Virtual Experiment (IVE) made in-house to isolate a control
valve was used to develop competency in preparing an equipment for maintenance.
Students will then demonstrate competency by transferring this learning
to the preparation of a process equipment by isolating a pump in a pump
circuit on a physical test skid in the workshop. Survey findings showed
that the IVE was effective as students were more engaged and could better
visualise and understand the rationale behind the steps to isolate a control
valve. Most agreed or strongly agreed that they felt more prepared to demonstrate
knowledge transfer to isolating and preparing a pump (equipment) for maintenance
in a physical setup. Finally, plans to continue development of the safey
mindset and other technical competences for process technicians using digital
technology in the DCHE curriculum are shared.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>We discuss the importance of learning support based on the study of correlations
between students' self-confidence and their actual learning performance
performance. Kosen in regional cities face the problem of a declining birth
rate problems, and often can't have enough applicants. Therefore, we have
to accept all applicants as new students. This means that an entrance examination
will not be functional enough to screen students' academic performance.
In view of the current situation, it is considered necessary for Kosen
to provide learning support for a wider range of academic performance levels
in order to maintain their educational level. On the other hand, students’
confidence in learning affects their motivation to learn and their future
careers. If students face some problems that decrease their motivation,
we read a sign of them and need to link to learning support. However, it
is very difficult to monitor each student's motivation to learn. Therefore,
we have tried to assess the freshmen's confidence in learning from their
scores on regular exams, which they predict themselves.</p>
<p>We ask each student the ideal (target) score they would like to get and
the realistic score (hereafter, realistic target score) they believe they
can get based on their self-assessment of learning just before each exam.
The survey included 156 freshmen and was conducted in all learning subjects.
In particular, we focus on the difference between the target score and
the actual exam score in each subject and define this difference as "confidence
in learning" in this round-year study. As a result, we find that the actual
score exceeds the realistic target score in the case of medium performing
students in each subject, and conversely, in the case of low performing
students, the realistic target score exceeds the actual score. These can
be observed throughout an academic year, and the tendency is also consistent
with the tendency indicated by the Dunning-Kruger effect, one of the cognitive
biases. As a result of the round-year survey, middle-performing students
will be able to assess appropriately. We conclude that it is considered
necessary for Kosen to provide learning support based on each confidence
in learning to maintain their educational level. We will discuss relationships
between learning support for students and their confidence in learning
quantitatively.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>To learn effectively, students must develop proficient reading skills,
encompassing various strategies for comprehending text. Among these strategies,
questioning enable learners to delve deeper into the content, exploring
key concepts, theories, and issues Posing questions before, during, and
after reading facilitates purposeful engagement, allowing readers to speculate
about events at various stages, clarify confusion, and monitor their understanding.
Hence, understanding the significance of questioning in the reading process
is essential for educators to cultivate proficient readers. The aim of
this project was to investigate the effectiveness of a 3-stage questioning
strategy in deeper comprehension of pre-reading resources. The strategy
involves posing questions before, during, and after engaging with the reading
materials, by guiding students' thought processes and fostering deeper
understanding.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This two-semester research project involved dividing a module into two
groups, A and B, each with approximately 75 students. Pre-reading resources
were provided to both groups, with the intervention group using a padlet
platform to record the generated questions before, during, and after reading.
Pre- and post-reading quizzes assessed comprehension, and data from surveys
and focus group interviews evaluated the strategy's effectiveness. Students
post reading quizzes score was higher than the pre-reading quizzes score,
but the different was statistically non-significant. The survey study showed
that more than 65% of students agree and strongly agree that the 3-stage
questioning strategy stimulated their prior knowledge, triggered their
curiosity and prepared them for upcoming lesson. The qualitative data from
the focus group discussion indicated that employing the 3-stage questioning
strategy increased active learning, critical thinking, and deeper comprehension.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This study aimed to use manga-incorporated health education materials
in health education and examine their effects on students' health knowledge
and their attitudes and impressions toward health education A total of
128 fourth-grade students at the National Institute of Technology, Ichinoseki
College were included in the study. The students participated in a health
class using manga-style teaching materials and answered questionnaires.
Questionnaires included a health knowledge test, a health class attitude
scale, and a health class subjective evaluation scale. The knowledge test
and the health class attitude scale were completed the day before the class
and at the end of the class. The knowledge test scores were compared using
a paired t-test, and significant differences were found before and after
the class. On the health class attitude scale, the percentage of students
who answered "Yes" to the question "The content covered in the health class
is interesting" increased from 46.9% before the class to 78.9% after the
class. The percentage of students who answered "Yes" to the question "The
health class has increased my interest in current health issues" increased
from 58.6% before the class to 83.6% after the class. In the subjective
evaluation scale of the health class, about 80% of the students responded
positively to the questions about the quality of the teaching materials
and the class attitude, such as "The teaching methods and materials were
well designed" and "I was enthusiastic about the class". Therefore, the
students responded positively to the manga-style teaching materials used
in this study. It is also believed that one of the reasons for the students'
active participation in the class was that the teaching materials increased
their interest in the content of the class. Through the incorporation of
manga materials in health education, students' health knowledge and their
attitudes and impressions toward health education improved.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This study explores the efficacy of reverse case study approach in optometry
training, where final year Diploma in Optometry (DOPT) students create
and solve cases akin to real-world scenarios. The approach was implemented
in the final year of clinical module, Paediatric Optometry, with the highlight
“Flip the Script” where student groups are paired and role-play as both
paediatric patients with the case history they created and as optometrist
performing case history procedures. Data were gathered from surveys of
students from the 2021 to 2023 cohorts, utilising 5 quantitative Likert
scale questions and 1 open-ended question to gauge their learning experiences.
Students' performances are assessed both during the role-play activity
in Term 1 and competency performance conducted at the end of the semester
in Term 2. The effects of the reverse case study are evaluated through
various metrics, including performance skills like information gathering,
questioning techniques and soft skills, as well as thinking skills with
diagnostic accuracy. A positive impact on learning was recorded across
all cohorts (n=138), with statistically significant improvements observed
in competency assessments post-implementation of reverse case study approach
(n=101, p value &lt;0.05). This study demonstrates the effectiveness and
potential of reverse case studies in enhancing the learning outcomes in
optometry education.</p>
