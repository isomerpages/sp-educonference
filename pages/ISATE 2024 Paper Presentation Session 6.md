<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The recent advancement in AI, in particular Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GAI), presents both challenges and opportunities for the educational sector.
This study explores the integration of GAI within our curriculum, aiming
to enhance AI literacy among students and assess the pedagogical effectiveness
of GAI as a learning assistant. Through a comprehensive literature review,
we identify a notable gap in the systematic incorporation of GAI tools
in teaching and learning processes. Addressing this gap, our research proposes
to incorporate the IDEE model and Bloom’s Taxonomy into the development
of a practical framework for integrating GAI into educational curricula.
The intent of this fusion is to offer educators a systematic framework
by using Bloom’s Taxonomy’s structured approach of cognitive objectives
to advocate the positive and meaningful embracement of GAI tools in educational
settings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This study presents a case study of integration of GAI into one module
of the Common Core Curriculum (CCC) suite: "Problem-Solving with Creative
and Computational Thinking" (PSCCT). We evaluate the impact of GAI integration
into the curriculum using a mixed-methods approach. The adaptation of the
Meta AI Literacy Scale (MAILS) facilitates a quantitative assessment of
students' AI literacy level. Qualitative data gathered from in-class activity
questions undergo thematic analysis to explore students' experiences and
interactions with GAI in learning activities targeted at different stages
of Bloom’s Taxonomy. This comprehensive approach combines the findings
to address two critical research questions: how the integration of GAI
into the curriculum influences the development of AI literacy among students,
and the effectiveness of integrating GAI into the curriculum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This study aims to contribute significantly to the discourse on AI in
education by offering a practical framework for GAI integration, alongside
empirical evidence of its educational benefits and insights into its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This paper presents the development and implementation of a Coordinating
Module Leader (CML) Dashboard within the School of Interdisciplinary Studies
(IS) in Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP), aimed at strengthening academic monitoring
and intervention strategies especially for very large modules with approximately
2000 students and 30 tutors each semester. Initiated during the April 2020
semester, the dashboard emerged as a practical response to the evolving
needs of IS, aligning with its commitment to fostering student success
through evidence-informed practices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The paper showcases IS's proactive approach in recognizing and addressing
emerging educational challenges enabled by data through the development
of the CML Dashboard. The dashboard serves as a versatile tool, offering
insights into student attendance and assessment grades across modules within
the IS CORE Curriculum. Its primary objective is to facilitate early identification
of at-risk students, enabling timely intervention and support mechanisms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The implementation of the dashboard has also proven productive in enhancing
academic oversight and intervention strategies. By providing CMLs with
data on student performance metrics, educators can make informed decisions
to address academic challenges more effectively. This approach ensures
targeted interventions tailored to the specific needs of students, thereby
maximising the impact of support initiatives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, the dashboard enables CMLs to monitor grading consistency
among tutors, ensuring fairness and transparency in assessment practices.
Through comparative analysis, CMLs can identify anomalies or discrepancies,
thereby upholding academic standards and integrity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This paper discusses the iterative development process of the dashboard,
from initiation to implementation, outlining the challenges encountered
and lessons learned. It aims to provide practical insights for institutions
seeking to enhance academic oversight through technology integration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The implementation of the CML Dashboard represents a significant step
towards enhancing academic monitoring and intervention in higher education.
By leveraging technology to provide evidence-informed insights, IS demonstrates
its commitment to continuous improvement and student success, fostering
a culture of excellence and accountability within the academic community.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) Professional Competency Model (PCM) revolutionises
the educational landscape by emphasising productivity, adaptability, and
responsiveness at the intersection of artificial intelligence and sustainability.
This model transforms education by strategically reusing learning content
and activities at task and competency unit levels, encapsulated in Reusable
Learning Objects (RLOs). These RLOs developed collaboratively across technical
domains and life skills, enable customised learning experiences across
disciplines, helping NYP align courses with industry demands and respond
promptly to job market needs. By strategically reusing RLOs, NYP saves
workforce and curriculum development resources, enhancing institutional
productivity and adaptability. This paper explores NYP's strategies for
effectively reusing curriculum, learning content, and activities, highlighting
the importance of cross-school collaboration in RLO development. The results
show that when RLOs are seamlessly integrated into the curriculum, they
significantly enhance instructional effectiveness, providing reassurance
about the quality of education. The results from a staff feedback survey
are presented in the paper, providing insights into the perceived quality
and usefulness of RLOs and ease of integration into lessons. Despite acknowledging
implementation challenges, the survey offers valuable lessons and areas
for improvement. This feedback loop ensures the continuous refinement and
optimisation of the NYP PCM to meet evolving educational needs, underscoring
its relevance in the current educational landscape. This paper contributes
to the ongoing discourse on teaching and learning paradigms in the age
of AI and sustainability, advocating for the strategic adoption of RLOs
as a catalyst for educational innovation and institutional resilience.
The transformative potential of this approach addresses the multi-faceted
challenges facing education, reinforcing the importance of adaptability
and resource efficiency in modern educational frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>
<p>In recent years, the proliferation of computers has underscored the critical
role of technology, particularly in embedded devices where microcomputers
are pivotal. Developing with microcomputers requires skills in hardware
integration and real-time performance, posing significant learning challenges.
This study details a six-month course using the "RA6M5" microcomputer,
divided into three phases. In the first phase, students acquire comprehensive
knowledge of embedded systems and electronic circuits. The second phase
involves lectures and practical exercises on systems thinking, microcomputer
architecture, and real-time operating systems (RTOS). In the third phase,
students engage in project-based learning, designing and developing prototype
embedded systems. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction and
improved understanding, although they noted areas for improvement such
as time constraints and clarity of explanations. This study demonstrates
the effectiveness of project-based learning in embedded device education.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Language teachers often discourage students’ use of translation software.
However, machine translation is a tool that can be effective when used
correctly and with understanding of its limitations. In first- and second-year
English communication classes, about 600 students learned about machine
translation and how to use it. Before talking about acceptable uses of
machine translation, it is important to consider its accuracy. In order
to consider the accuracy of machine translation, students worked in groups
on an activity using Google Translate, DeepL, and Bing to translate English
and Japanese proverbs from one language into the other. Proverbs are a
great way to measure accuracy because the words in the proverbs used to
express the same meaning are very different from one language to the next.
Before the class, students had used Quizlet word sets to study the proverbs,
so they would know the equivalent proverbs before doing the activity. This
knowledge was important so they could consider the accuracy of the translations.
At the beginning of class before the activity, students completed a short
survey about how they use machine translation and how accurate they think
it is. Before the collaborative portion of the activity, we then talked
about the different types of translations they were likely to encounter.
During the activity, students worked in groups and completed a spreadsheet
with the translations produced by the machine translation software. They
were told to notice the translations and how correct they think the translations
are while completing the table. Once all of the proverbs were translated,
there was a discussion about what makes a correct and good translation.
After the activity, students completed a second survey about what they
learned about machine translation and how their perceptions of its accuracy
had changed. This paper will look at the current accuracy of and recent
evolution of machine translation, how the proverb translation activity
was executed, and how it impacted students’ perceptions of machine translation.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The Diploma in Chemical Engineering (DCHE) implemented a suite of 4 skills-based
module in its spiral curriculum to progressively develop in students a
safety mindset alongside the technical competencies required by process
technicians in the chemical processing industries as specified in the Singapore
Skills Framework. The work reported in this paper focusses on the training
of students to prepare equipment for maintenance (mechanical work) in a
module Process Operation Skills 1 (POS1). Preparation of equipment to render
it safe for maintenance requires students to apply Workplace Safety and
Health (WSH) through identification of hazards and the control measures
to take, and application of the Safe System of Work (SSoW) framework and
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) according to the process where the equipment
is used. Due to the students' lack of real-world working experience and
the absence of prior experience in mechnical work, learning of WSH and
SSoW in this context was done by referencing prior knowledge of WSH learnt
previously then scaffolded gradually across several learning activities
in POS1. Research has shown that immersive digital technology benefits
student learning through its degree of realism that allows easy transfer
of learnt skills and knowledge to real life and its student-centricness
that allows self-paced learning, and repeated practice for tasks. Therefore,
an Immersive Virtual Experiment (IVE) made in-house to isolate a control
valve was used to develop competency in preparing an equipment for maintenance.
Students will then demonstrate competency by transferring this learning
to the preparation of a process equipment by isolating a pump in a pump
circuit on a physical test skid in the workshop. Survey findings showed
that the IVE was effective as students were more engaged and could better
visualise and understand the rationale behind the steps to isolate a control
valve. Most agreed or strongly agreed that they felt more prepared to demonstrate
knowledge transfer to isolating and preparing a pump (equipment) for maintenance
in a physical setup. Finally, plans to continue development of the safey
mindset and other technical competences for process technicians using digital
technology in the DCHE curriculum are shared.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>We discuss the importance of learning support based on the study of correlations
between students' self-confidence and their actual learning performance
performance. Kosen in regional cities face the problem of a declining birth
rate problems, and often can't have enough applicants. Therefore, we have
to accept all applicants as new students. This means that an entrance examination
will not be functional enough to screen students' academic performance.
In view of the current situation, it is considered necessary for Kosen
to provide learning support for a wider range of academic performance levels
in order to maintain their educational level. On the other hand, students’
confidence in learning affects their motivation to learn and their future
careers. If students face some problems that decrease their motivation,
we read a sign of them and need to link to learning support. However, it
is very difficult to monitor each student's motivation to learn. Therefore,
we have tried to assess the freshmen's confidence in learning from their
scores on regular exams, which they predict themselves.</p>
<p>We ask each student the ideal (target) score they would like to get and
the realistic score (hereafter, realistic target score) they believe they
can get based on their self-assessment of learning just before each exam.
The survey included 156 freshmen and was conducted in all learning subjects.
In particular, we focus on the difference between the target score and
the actual exam score in each subject and define this difference as "confidence
in learning" in this round-year study. As a result, we find that the actual
score exceeds the realistic target score in the case of medium performing
students in each subject, and conversely, in the case of low performing
students, the realistic target score exceeds the actual score. These can
be observed throughout an academic year, and the tendency is also consistent
with the tendency indicated by the Dunning-Kruger effect, one of the cognitive
biases. As a result of the round-year survey, middle-performing students
will be able to assess appropriately. We conclude that it is considered
necessary for Kosen to provide learning support based on each confidence
in learning to maintain their educational level. We will discuss relationships
between learning support for students and their confidence in learning
quantitatively.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>To learn effectively, students must develop proficient reading skills,
encompassing various strategies for comprehending text. Among these strategies,
questioning enable learners to delve deeper into the content, exploring
key concepts, theories, and issues Posing questions before, during, and
after reading facilitates purposeful engagement, allowing readers to speculate
about events at various stages, clarify confusion, and monitor their understanding.
Hence, understanding the significance of questioning in the reading process
is essential for educators to cultivate proficient readers. The aim of
this project was to investigate the effectiveness of a 3-stage questioning
strategy in deeper comprehension of pre-reading resources. The strategy
involves posing questions before, during, and after engaging with the reading
materials, by guiding students' thought processes and fostering deeper
understanding.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This two-semester research project involved dividing a module into two
groups, A and B, each with approximately 75 students. Pre-reading resources
were provided to both groups, with the intervention group using a padlet
platform to record the generated questions before, during, and after reading.
Pre- and post-reading quizzes assessed comprehension, and data from surveys
and focus group interviews evaluated the strategy's effectiveness. Students
post reading quizzes score was higher than the pre-reading quizzes score,
but the different was statistically non-significant. The survey study showed
that more than 65% of students agree and strongly agree that the 3-stage
questioning strategy stimulated their prior knowledge, triggered their
curiosity and prepared them for upcoming lesson. The qualitative data from
the focus group discussion indicated that employing the 3-stage questioning
strategy increased active learning, critical thinking, and deeper comprehension.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This study aimed to use manga-incorporated health education materials
in health education and examine their effects on students' health knowledge
and their attitudes and impressions toward health education A total of
128 fourth-grade students at the National Institute of Technology, Ichinoseki
College were included in the study. The students participated in a health
class using manga-style teaching materials and answered questionnaires.
Questionnaires included a health knowledge test, a health class attitude
scale, and a health class subjective evaluation scale. The knowledge test
and the health class attitude scale were completed the day before the class
and at the end of the class. The knowledge test scores were compared using
a paired t-test, and significant differences were found before and after
the class. On the health class attitude scale, the percentage of students
who answered "Yes" to the question "The content covered in the health class
is interesting" increased from 46.9% before the class to 78.9% after the
class. The percentage of students who answered "Yes" to the question "The
health class has increased my interest in current health issues" increased
from 58.6% before the class to 83.6% after the class. In the subjective
evaluation scale of the health class, about 80% of the students responded
positively to the questions about the quality of the teaching materials
and the class attitude, such as "The teaching methods and materials were
well designed" and "I was enthusiastic about the class". Therefore, the
students responded positively to the manga-style teaching materials used
in this study. It is also believed that one of the reasons for the students'
active participation in the class was that the teaching materials increased
their interest in the content of the class. Through the incorporation of
manga materials in health education, students' health knowledge and their
attitudes and impressions toward health education improved.</p>

<p>This study explores the efficacy of reverse case study approach in optometry
training, where final year Diploma in Optometry (DOPT) students create
and solve cases akin to real-world scenarios. The approach was implemented
in the final year of clinical module, Paediatric Optometry, with the highlight
“Flip the Script” where student groups are paired and role-play as both
paediatric patients with the case history they created and as optometrist
performing case history procedures. Data were gathered from surveys of
students from the 2021 to 2023 cohorts, utilising 5 quantitative Likert
scale questions and 1 open-ended question to gauge their learning experiences.
Students' performances are assessed both during the role-play activity
in Term 1 and competency performance conducted at the end of the semester
in Term 2. The effects of the reverse case study are evaluated through
various metrics, including performance skills like information gathering,
questioning techniques and soft skills, as well as thinking skills with
diagnostic accuracy. A positive impact on learning was recorded across
all cohorts (n=138), with statistically significant improvements observed
in competency assessments post-implementation of reverse case study approach
(n=101, p value &lt;0.05). This study demonstrates the effectiveness and
potential of reverse case studies in enhancing the learning outcomes in
optometry education.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>By introducing technology in a tangible and accessible manner, the Logistics
Sandbox aims to demystify critical Industry 4.0 (i4.0) technologies for
business students. Through early exposure to these transformative technologies,
students are primed to cultivate a deeper understanding and affinity towards
applied Industry 4.0 concepts. This initiative serves as a precursor to
future coursework in smart manufacturing and logistics, nurturing a fertile
ground for further exploration and innovation. Within the Logistics Sandbox,
six experiential stations have been curated to facilitate hands-on workshops
lasting from one to three hours each. These stations are tailored for versatility,
enabling their deployment in various learning and outreach initiatives
across diverse locations. The stations include Sensor Applications in Warehouse
Environmental Monitoring and Carton Box Dimensioning, Warehouse Motion
Monitoring with Camera, Warehouse Order Picking &amp; Routing Optimization
Game, Introduction to Robotics, Logistics Data Analytics &amp; Demand Forecasting,
and simulating Distribution Centre Picking Operations through VR. Each
station provides practical insights and hands-on activities to ignite learners’
curiosity and enhance their understanding of key logistics technologies.
Trial workshops were conducted for students as knowledge-building exercises
on how to facilitate workshops for a varied target audience, ranging from
pre-poly students to freshmen business students. The goal was to introduce
participants to the evolving landscape of technology in their respective
industries, from the early stages of Industry 1.0 to the advancements of
Industry 4.0. The feedback from participants highlighted the workshops
impact, with many students expressing how the sessions expanded their horizons
and provided valuable insights into technology-driven solutions. A number
of participants expressed their desire to continue exploring the technology
associated with the Logistics Sandbox, demonstrating an interest in technology
related experiential learning.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Instruction Traditional math instruction often leads to student disengagement.
Students struggle to see the relevance of the skills they're learning,
resulting in a disconnect between theory and practical application. This
action research addresses this challenge by introducing real-world application
problems through short trigger videos before teaching the necessary mathematical
skills. This "begin with the end in mind" approach aims to spark student
interest and curiosity at the outset, fostering a deeper understanding
of the purpose and relevance of the mathematical concepts being taught.</p>
<p>The study involved dividing module topics into manageable blocks. Each
block features three key elements:</p>
<p>1. Trigger Video: A captivating video (around 6 minutes) introduces a
real-world application problem. It is designed to be relevant to students'
lives and experiences.</p>
<p>2. Skill Development: Targeted instruction focused on the mathematical
skills needed to solve the application problem.</p>
<p>3. Application Practice: Students apply the newly acquired skills to solve
the application problem introduced in the trigger video.</p>
<p>The duration of a block (1-4 weeks) depends on the complexity of the application
problem. One of the blocks included an additional assignment related to
the application.</p>
<p>Surveys using a Likert scale and open-ended questions were administered
to students and teachers. 14 staff and 566 students from 4 schools participated
in the surveys. The results indicated that the application problems piqued
student interest in math and helped them see its relevance in real life.
Most teachers found this approach of introducing the application first
to be more beneficial than the traditional method of teaching skills first.
Implementing this approach in another math module yielded similar positive
results.</p>
<p>This research proposes a portable pedagogy that has the potential to be
applied across math modules to enhance student engagement and foster a
deeper understanding of the subject's relevance.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In this study, the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education at the
National Institute of Technology is discussed. The National Institute of
Technology called KOSEN is one of Japan's higher education institutions
where students mostly specialize in engineering. The Ministry of Education,
Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) started entrepreneurship
education at Kosen in 2023. What is the effect of the entrepreneurship
education on KOSEN students? This study examines the effect of the entrepreneurship
education based on the case surveys. The entrepreneurship education started
in 2023 at KOSEN. The entrepreneurship education at Fukushima KOSEN is
an optional subject for the first-year students. In this study, the author
provided the questionnaire to the students. The author assigned the students
essays because the author tries to find the details of student’s attitude
in the essay. The author analyzed their essays using KH-Coder text analyzer
which is available as a computer software package for text mining. In this
study, the students have positive impacts on tolerance for uncertainty,
interpersonal skills, initiative, and proactivity. In addition, the students
improve their communication and teamwork. The students could collaborate
and communicate with each other, and they created business ideas throughout
the course. In this study, positive effects of entrepreneurship education
at Fukushima KOSEN were shown.</p>

</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Covid-19 was the catalyst for many changes in pedagogy, one of which included
the adoption and acceptance of asynchronous lectures. A recent large-scale
study with 1214 respondents found that students have positive attitudes
towards asynchronous lectures and find the medium efficacious (Soo et al.,
2023). However, this result comes with the important caveat that the students
prefer “social presence” in the recorded videos (which, in the study, comprises
of live narration and/or a teacher’s thumbnail). Subsequently, a second
survey with 3159 participants was conducted to investigate the effectiveness
of student engagement during asynchronous lectures. It was observed that
modules with lower engagement scores had predominantly relied on external
open-source learning materials that are commonly adopted by many higher
education institutions for professional certification. While these certified
resources facilitate valuable industry connections and enhance graduates’
marketability, this sparks concern regarding their efficacy in student
learning experiences because of the noted low level of engagement. In view
of the students’ desires for the instructor presence during learning, the
lack of engagement may stem from the lack of “social presence” in the external
learning materials rather than the quality of the materials.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus, to test this hypothesis, pre-recorded advance organiser videos were
developed to enhance the asynchronous learning experience with social presence.
These advance organisers serve as scaffolding for complex concepts, promoting
greater engagement with the course materials. The approach integrated quantitative
and qualitative analyses through surveys and content review. A two-tailed
statistical analysis of students’ survey results found that implementing
advance organizer videos significantly improved students’ self-reported
engagement levels from 4.23 to 4.63, (t (228) = 2.07, P = 0.0390). This
underscores the significance of maintaining human connection and adapting
tried-and-true methods of student engagement, even with the rising popularity
of asynchronous lectures.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This paper documents students’ favourable responses to advance organiser
videos and offers recommendations for optimising their implementation.
The authors hope these insights drawn from student experiences will provide
valuable guidance to educators aiming to enhance instructional strategies
within open-source learning contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Japan faces frequent natural disasters due to its geographical location.
The archipelago lies within the Ring of Fire, where approximately 80% of
the world’s active volcanoes are concentrated. Consequently, the entire
Japanese territory is susceptible to high seismic risk. Although the regions
that have risks of flood and tsunami are limited to the alluvial plains
that account 10% of the territory, they account 50% of the population in
Japan and 75% of the assets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2020, the ruling government introduced the concept of Self-help, Mutual
Aid, and Public Assistance for disaster response. The order of sequence
of these words emphasizes self-help as the most critical activity immediately
after a disaster happens. Given that many disasters escalate over time,
minimizing the lead time—the time required to move to a safe location immediately
after a disaster event—is crucial for survival. Therefore, in regional
disaster preparedness, lead time is equivalent to the time it takes to
travel from the current location to an evacuation area. To reduce evacuation
time, students at the National Institute of Technology, Ishikawa College
(Ishikawa KOSEN) have been promoting the use of Urban Hazard Signs since
2022. This sign consists of a pictogram, an evacuation site name, a distance,
and a QR code indicating evacuation routes. A total of a dozen signs in
2022 and 142 signs in 2023 were installed, covering the entire target area.
The installation process involved coordination with stakeholders such as
local municipalities and residents based on iterative cycles of feedback,
on-site surveys, trial production, placement, and post-installation surveys.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This initiative, combining regional challenges and practical education,
received high acclaim in the National Institute of Technology Contests
and achieved consecutive awards in 2022 and 2023. Furthermore, a local
municipality, Tsubata Town has entrusted the sign installation task to
Ishikawa KOSEN in its 2023 supplementary budget, with plans for continued
activities in subsequent years.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In a world defined by rapid technological change and the blurring of traditional
business functions, educators face the challenge of infusing technology
into existing curricula while equipping students with 21st-century skill
sets for success in the workplace. This paper presents an innovative approach
to transformational business education, developed and implemented at Ngee
Ann Polytechnic in Singapore.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Traditional academic programs often fail to keep pace with the rapid technological
changes in the workplace. This leaves graduates unprepared for the demands
of a digital economy.  The Business Digitalisation Track (BDT) at Ngee
Ann Polytechnic's School of Business and Accountancy (BA) addresses this
gap. The BDT's focus on digital skills provides students with the essential
tools to navigate this evolving business landscape. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The BDT is a one-year, cross-diploma program integrating internships for
selected final-year students. The program's core strategies are to "bring
the industries into the classroom" and "bring the classroom into the industries."
This is achieved through a collaborative model with industry partners,
who co-design, co-teach, and co-evaluate courses alongside educators. </p>
<p></p>
<p>BDT's unconventional curricular structure features an emphasis on competency-based
training, replacing traditional modules and exams with intensive workshops,
seminars, real-world company projects, and industry-based certifications.
Two project-based internships are integrated into the curricular structure
to enhance digital skills application and knowledge acquisition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Student and industry feedback indicate significant learner transformation.
Students gain relevant digital skills, enhanced adaptability, and independence.
Companies value student contributions in projects such as digital playbooks
and livestreaming. The program's model has influenced changes within BA’s
other diploma programmes and has been adapted for adult learners pursuing
Continuing Education and Training (CET) at NP.  As a case in point, a new
programme in Digital Marketing &amp; Digital Commerce, modelled after the
BDT, was introduced for working adults planning career transitions.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>A survey to evaluate the curricula structure of the BDT was conducted
in 2020 and the results validated the effectiveness of the program.  Results
show that a vast majority of students were in strong agreement that the
structure of this programme had a positive impact on their learning and
motivation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The BDT's success demonstrates the value of industry collaboration in
preparing students for the complexities of digital business.  Looking ahead,
plans for scaling include extending "classroom in the industry" through
broader and deeper industry partnerships.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This study examines the effectiveness of the Business Essentials Through
Action (BETA) module at the Singapore Polytechnic School of Business in
fostering entrepreneurial competencies through self-directed learning.
Our research anchors on the premise that self-directed learning, as a critical
component of entrepreneurial education, enhances critical thinking, creativity,
resilience, and adaptability—skills vital for navigating today’s business
challenges. Utilising a mixed-methods approach, the study contrasts the
entrepreneurial competencies of students engaged in the BETA module with
those in a traditional curriculum. Quantitative assessments through pre-post
tests and qualitative insights from focus groups were used to evaluate
the impact of the BETA module. The findings suggest significant improvements
in competencies such as "Opportunity Seeking and Initiative," "Persistence,"
"Demand for Efficiency and Quality," and "Systematic Planning and Monitoring"
for students in the BETA group compared to their peers. This study contributes
to the educational discourse by demonstrating how integrative frameworks
combining experiential learning with reflective practices can effectively
cultivate the entrepreneurial skills necessary for today’s complex economic
landscape. The results underscore the potential of self-directed learning
models to bridge gaps in traditional education methods and significantly
enhance entrepreneurial competency development.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Advertising with food photos on websites has commonly utilized among web
marketers, as local restaurants have emphasized emotional impact of digital
images using interactive information services with customers. However,
due to declining local population and aging society, current situation
is that information technology implementation in the local areas has fell
behind, and it has been difficult to revitalize the local businesses and
create a new information service. Open and consumer-centred online communication
and interaction over human-centred computing are required in order to promote
local business revitalization.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a solution to the problem, multi-institution collaborations such as
the local colleges and universities, the local city hall, and the local
chambers of commerce has created a new information service as well as opportunities
of students’ learning in website technology and development. In particular,
a group of local restaurants that had sales reduction have been supported
by multi-institution collaboration websites that college students developed
in order to revitalize the local businesses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This study tested two hypotheses. Firstly, Websites would increase involvement,
which improve online communication among people and lead to increase the
potential restaurant customers. Secondly, digitalization would promote
local establishment, that is, creation of information services requires
human resources who stay in the region and engage in that information technology
businesses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Data has been obtained from the National Household Survey, website analytics,
website usability test, and the local Chamber of Commerce data to conduct
hypothesis test. Data analysis found that frequent view of product photos
increased consumers’ interest, and reduced consumers’ emotional stress
against unfamiliar food. As a result, two hypotheses were supported with
positive effects that websites increased online activities and involvement
to the local restaurants, and has established a new information business
and handover in the local area even after COVID-19.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This research supports multi-institution collaboration with utilizing

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In FY2017, the National Institute of Technology, Ichinoseki College (Ichinoseki
KOSEN) reorganized from the previous four departments to one department,
four divisions, and seven fields to respond to social needs and regional
changes and enable new development and expansion. In line with this, a
new Department of Information and Software Engineering was established.
Although each of the two existing departments had its own information course,
it was decided to organize a new curriculum specializing in the field of
information engineering. The first batch of students graduated in March
2022, and all subjects of the new curriculum were offered; however, in
the course of practical education, they were adapted to the rapid development
of technology. This situation called for more practical lectures and exercises.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Therefore, in April 2022, the school hired six practitioner teachers in
the fields of cyber security, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning
and social implementation project management to accept professional personnel
from the private sector as “sideline teachers” in education. Since the
first semester’s courses in FY2022, practical exercises and lectures on
the latest technology topics have been held for senior information and
software students and others, with FY2024 marking the third year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This paper presents examples of initiatives in the field of cyber security
and discusses their educational benefits and challenge.</p>
