<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The recent advancement in AI, in particular Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GAI), presents both challenges and opportunities for the educational sector.
This study explores the integration of GAI within our curriculum, aiming
to enhance AI literacy among students and assess the pedagogical effectiveness
of GAI as a learning assistant. Through a comprehensive literature review,
we identify a notable gap in the systematic incorporation of GAI tools
in teaching and learning processes. Addressing this gap, our research proposes
to incorporate the IDEE model and Bloom’s Taxonomy into the development
of a practical framework for integrating GAI into educational curricula.
The intent of this fusion is to offer educators a systematic framework
by using Bloom’s Taxonomy’s structured approach of cognitive objectives
to advocate the positive and meaningful embracement of GAI tools in educational
settings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This study presents a case study of integration of GAI into one module
of the Common Core Curriculum (CCC) suite: "Problem-Solving with Creative
and Computational Thinking" (PSCCT). We evaluate the impact of GAI integration
into the curriculum using a mixed-methods approach. The adaptation of the
Meta AI Literacy Scale (MAILS) facilitates a quantitative assessment of
students' AI literacy level. Qualitative data gathered from in-class activity
questions undergo thematic analysis to explore students' experiences and
interactions with GAI in learning activities targeted at different stages
of Bloom’s Taxonomy. This comprehensive approach combines the findings
to address two critical research questions: how the integration of GAI
into the curriculum influences the development of AI literacy among students,
and the effectiveness of integrating GAI into the curriculum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This study aims to contribute significantly to the discourse on AI in
education by offering a practical framework for GAI integration, alongside
empirical evidence of its educational benefits and insights into its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The objective of this pilot study is to investigate the effectiveness
of using digital humans powered by generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)
in service quality training. There were 69 full-time learners taking the
Service Quality Management subject in the Diploma in Aviation Management
who participated in this study. It was conducted from January to February
2024. A pre and post survey were conducted using the RATER framework, which
measures reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy and responsiveness
of the students in a given scenario. The pre and post survey were administered
before and after the intervention (role-play with digital humans powered
by GenAI) was introduced. This is used to investigate the extent of a learner’s
improved knowledge, skills and attitudes.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This paper presents the development and implementation of a Coordinating
Module Leader (CML) Dashboard within the School of Interdisciplinary Studies
(IS) in Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP), aimed at strengthening academic monitoring
and intervention strategies especially for very large modules with approximately
2000 students and 30 tutors each semester. Initiated during the April 2020
semester, the dashboard emerged as a practical response to the evolving
needs of IS, aligning with its commitment to fostering student success
through evidence-informed practices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The paper showcases IS's proactive approach in recognizing and addressing
emerging educational challenges enabled by data through the development
of the CML Dashboard. The dashboard serves as a versatile tool, offering
insights into student attendance and assessment grades across modules within
the IS CORE Curriculum. Its primary objective is to facilitate early identification
of at-risk students, enabling timely intervention and support mechanisms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The implementation of the dashboard has also proven productive in enhancing
academic oversight and intervention strategies. By providing CMLs with
data on student performance metrics, educators can make informed decisions
to address academic challenges more effectively. This approach ensures
targeted interventions tailored to the specific needs of students, thereby
maximising the impact of support initiatives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, the dashboard enables CMLs to monitor grading consistency
among tutors, ensuring fairness and transparency in assessment practices.
Through comparative analysis, CMLs can identify anomalies or discrepancies,
thereby upholding academic standards and integrity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This paper discusses the iterative development process of the dashboard,
from initiation to implementation, outlining the challenges encountered
and lessons learned. It aims to provide practical insights for institutions
seeking to enhance academic oversight through technology integration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The implementation of the CML Dashboard represents a significant step
towards enhancing academic monitoring and intervention in higher education.
By leveraging technology to provide evidence-informed insights, IS demonstrates
its commitment to continuous improvement and student success, fostering
a culture of excellence and accountability within the academic community.</p>
